       "   'raw_content': 'Coalition urges California attorney general to halt OpenAI’s for-profit restructuring\\nSAN FRANCISCO \\xa0—\\xa0A coalition of California nonprofits, foundations and labor groups are raising concerns about ChatGPT maker OpenAI, urging the state attorney general to halt the artificial intelligence startup’s plans to restructure itself as a for-profit company.\\nMore than 50 organizations, led by LatinoProsperity and the San Francisco Foundation, signed a petition that was sent to Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta’s office on Wednesday, requesting he investigate the Sam Altman-led company.\\n“OpenAI began its work with the goal of developing AI to benefit humanity as a whole, but its current attempt to alter its corporate structure reveals its new goal: providing AI’s benefits — the potential for untold profits and control over what may become powerful world-altering technologies — to a handful of corporate investors and high-level employees,” the petition said.\\nSan Francisco-based OpenAI began as a nonprofit in 2015 and later launched a for-profit subsidiary to oversee its commercial operations. Currently, the nonprofit’s board oversees that subsidiary, which develops products and services including ChatGPT and text-to-video tool Sora.\\nHollywood Inc.\\nElon Musk’s feud with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, explained\\nElon Musk’s legal dispute against OpenAI could affect the future of one of the most prominent leaders in artificial intelligence.\\nBut as the competition among AI companies heated up, OpenAI said it needed to change its business structure to raise more money. In December, OpenAI said it would explore transitioning its commercial subsidiary into a public benefit corporation, a type of for-profit business where the OpenAI nonprofit would have an ownership stake but would no longer control it.\\nWhen OpenAI began as a nonprofit research lab, there were no plans for a product — just plans to put out research papers, Altman told newsletter Stratechery in March.\\nMore to Read\\nAn AI ‘gold rush.’ What to know about OpenAI’s record $40-billion funding round\\nOpenAI finalizes a record $40-billion funding round\\nHollywood creatives urge government to defend copyright laws against AI\\nOver time, OpenAI has grown to be a leader in the AI space, with 500 million people using ChatGPT weekly. If he could go back, Altman said he would have set up the company differently.\\n“We knew that scaling computers was going to be important, but we still really underestimated how much we needed to scale them,” Altman said in a conversation with Harvard Business School.\\nOther AI startups including Anthropic and xAI are public benefit corporations.\\nThe proposed change in OpenAI’s structure raised eyebrows among some nonprofit leaders. The petition was doubtful that OpenAI’s charitable assets would be protected, accused OpenAI of not complying with nonprofit rules and raised concerns that other startups would use a nonprofit structure “to create accelerated and amplified possibilities for individual financial benefit.”\\nOpenAI’s nonprofit board went through a major shakeup in 2023. The board voted to fire Altman for alleged lack of consistent candor in his communications with board members. He was later reinstated five days later and the board was restructured, with several opposing board members leaving.\\nBusiness\\nAn AI ‘gold rush.’ What to know about OpenAI’s record $40-billion funding round\\nThe latest $40-billion investment round will bring the ChatGPT’s valuation to $300 billion.\\nThis month, OpenAI said it completed a $40-billion funding round led by SoftBank, bringing its valuation to $300 billion. As part of the deal, SoftBank can reduce its investment if OpenAI does not change its corporate structure by the end of the year.\\nUnlike for-profit businesses, nonprofits are limited in how funds raised are used.\\n“They can’t sell stock or offer returns,” said Neil Elan, a partner at law firm Stubbs, Alderton and Markiles LLP. “Equity is what drives a lot of these high valuation models. It’s also difficult to fully compete with Meta, Microsoft and Google, which have access to a lot more resources ... without comparable funding.”\\nOpenAI now ranks as the second most valuable privately held company, tied with TikTok’s parent company ByteDance, according to research firm CB Insights. The private firm with the highest valuation is Elon Musk’s SpaceX at $350 billion.\\n“This is a kind of unprecedented conversion in terms of its size and we just want to make sure that the attorney general really exercises his powers to protect those charitable assets,” said Orson Aguilar, CEO and founding president of LatinoProsperity, an L.A.-based nonprofit that focuses on advancing policies that build wealth in the Latino community.\\nHollywood Inc.\\nOpenAI takes its pitch to Hollywood creatives after launching controversial video tool\\nOpenAI held a screening event on Wednesday, where several filmmakers touted work they made with the startup’s text-to-video tool Sora.\\nSome nonprofit leaders said what’s happening with OpenAI reminds them of the transition that nonprofit healthcare providers made to for-profits in the 1990s. Government leaders stepped in to help regulate that process.\\nLatinoProsperity, San Francisco Foundation and other nonprofits first raised concerns to the attorney general in January.\\nBonta has sought more information regarding OpenAI’s restructuring, with his deputy attorney general reaching out to the AI startup and requesting it provide more details. Earlier this year, Bonta’s office told news outlet CalMatters that it’s an ongoing investigation and the department “is committed to protecting charitable assets for their intended purpose and takes this responsibility seriously.”\\nAguilar says “there hasn’t been any meaningful action.”\\nSome of OpenAI’s competitors have opposed the company’s plans. Last year, Meta wrote to the attorney general. Musk, a co-founder of OpenAI who now runs rival xAI, sued OpenAI, seeking to stop OpenAI from changing its corporate structure.\\nNathanael Fast, director of the Neely Center for Ethical Leadership and Decision Making at USC Marshall School of Business, thinks OpenAI will be able to move forward with its plans despite the opposition.\\n“The big question is, what will happen to the values that they have once all the dust settles and they become a corporation that is competing with other for-profit corporations?” Fast said. “Will they have unique values that they hold on to from their early days as a nonprofit? Or will they look just like any other profit-oriented company?”\\nInside the business of entertainment\\nThe Wide Shot brings you news, analysis and insights on everything from streaming wars to production — and what it all means for the future.\\nYou may occasionally receive promotional content from the Los Angeles Times.\\nFollow Us\\nWendy Lee is an entertainment business reporter, covering streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV+.

A recent report by the International Monetary Fund showed that more than half of all patents by high-frequency or algorithmic trading firms are now related to AI.\\nBut its use stands to create new vulnerabilities, including “data poisoning”, where bad actors manipulate AI training models.

We’re back bright and early after last night’s tech power list soiree; work hard, play hard, right? Send feedback, tips and story ideas to californiadecoded@politico.com.\\nDriving the day\\nINSIDE LOOK: ABOUT LAST NIGHT — San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie delivered a clear pitch last night to the tech sector — and to the broader business elite — to join his mission of reviving the city, during the launch event for California Decoded.\\nCalling it “a city on the rise,” Lurie cast technology as a cornerstone of his campaign to “reclaim our place as the greatest city in the world.” And he laid it on thick: “We are letting the world know that we are open for business again. We want to embrace technology. We are the home of AI.”\\nBut as he admitted, the power to keep the comeback going is in the hands of industry leaders, whom other neighboring cities are eager to court. “Now the question is, do they stay, and can we keep those companies here long term?” Lurie said. “That is a commitment that we are going to make.”\\nLurie pointed to a flashy recent win: convincing the AI software startup Databricks to deepen its investment in San Francisco last month with more than $1 billion over the next three years, rather than decamp to Las Vegas. After talks with Lurie that began in December, the company pledged to open a bigger headquarters in the city and hold its annual user conference there for the near future.\\n“They want to compete with Dreamforce,” Lurie added. “And they’re keeping their presence here in San Francisco until 2030.”\\nIt’s all part of his broader effort to rope tech leaders into the orbit of City Hall and rally a new wave of local engagement. While San Francisco has remained the undisputed center of AI research, home base to OpenAI, Anthropic and even xAI, Lurie’s eyes are on the bigger prize: conference bookings that signal major corporate buy-in and long-term confidence in his leadership.\\nOf course, his message was not all tech boosterism. Lurie pointed to his public safety undertakings, including his work to tackle the behavioral health and homelessness crises by moving more people into treatment and shelter.\\nSPOTTED: Attendees included Lurie; former Sen. Laphonza Butler (D-Calif.); Assemblymember Buffy Wicks; Democratic political strategist and former Newsom chief of staff Jim DeBoo; Newsomland figures Juan Rodriguez, Nathan Click, Dan Newman and Brian Brokaw; Uber’s Ramona Prieto and Zahid Arab; political and tech consultant Peter Ragone; KP Public Affairs’ Jon Ross; Ellie Bloom from Attorney General Rob Bonta’s office; Jenny Kuo, Ellen Chen and Mateo Chang from the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in San Francisco; the U.K.'s Consul General in San Francisco Tammy Sandhu; Heirloom’s Vikrum Aiyer, an Obama alum; Lyft’s Terra Carmichael; Anthropic’s Hank Dempsey; Fathom co-founders Andrew Freedman and Bri Treece; Berkeley Professor Emeritus Jack Citrin; TrueDot CEO Jon Cohen; Pano AI’s Peter Ambler, political director for Abundant SF Todd David; Tasha Dean, chief communications officer for San Jose Mayor Matt Mahan; Tom Temprano of Equality California; Teri Olle at Economic Security California Action; political consultant Max Szabo; and Chime’s Avery Jaffe; Chris Gruwell, CEO at New Deal Advisers; Claudia Flores at LinkedIn.\\nAnd from the main stage: Our fearless editor Emma Anderson unveiled Decoded’s complete who’s-who list of the 20 most influential players in California tech. Here’s a reminder of the honorees:\\n— The rule-makers, for their roles defining tech policy by passing, or vetoing, landmark legislation: Gov. Gavin Newsom; Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan; State Senator Scott Wiener; and Wicks.\\n— On the other side of the coin, the disruptors: those not afraid to speak their mind and push the envelope — often butting heads with the rule-makers: Elon Musk; Garry Tan; and Marc Andreessen.\\n— The watchdogs: the people often keeping an eye on the social impacts of industry, often pushing for ways to rein it in: Executive Director Tom Kemp & the CPPA board; Peter Finn & the Teamsters; and Common Sense Media founder Jim Steyer\\n— The influencers: these are people often working behind the scenes to impact politics and policy: Newsom’s AI working group: Fei-Fei Li, Chayes, Mariano-Florentino Cuéllar; Anthropic’s Dario & Daniela Amodei; Meta’s Mona Pasquil Rogers; OpenAI’s Chris Lehane; and Prieto\\n— And finally the spenders: These people and the groups they represent play a major role through their funding efforts: Nvidia’s Jensen Huang; Marc Benioff; Ron Conway; Reid Hoffman and for Google — one of the biggest spenders in the state — Kent Walker & Ross.\\nA message from Fathom:\\nFathom is a 501(c)3 AI non-profit that finds, builds, and scales solutions for our transition to a world with AI. Stay up to date on the latest AI news – Sign up for Fathom’s Daily Dispatch.\\nHAPPENING TODAY\\n9 a.m. — The Assembly Appropriations Committee meets to consider a truckload of bills, including: Republican Phillip Chen’s proposal to lower crypto trading licensing fees (AB 236); Democrat Lori Wilson’s bot disclosure bill (AB 410); and Democrat Marc Berman’s proposed computer science course requirement for California high schoolers (AB 887).\\n1:30 p.m. — The Assembly Communications and Conveyance Committee meets to hear testimony on Democratic bills that would establish a statewide broadband office (Tasha Boerner’s AB 693) and impose internet speed transparency requirements on broadband providers (Mia Bonta’s AB 1271).\\n1:30 p.m. — The Assembly Education Committee hears testimony on two bills — Democrat Joaquin Arambula’s AB 235 and Republican Josh Hoover’s AB 962 — that would tweak California’s school phone restriction policy passed last year. Also on the docket: an effort to crack down on out-of-school cyberbullying from Democrat Josh Lowenthal (AB 772).\\nArtificial Intelligence\\nEXCLUSIVE: OPENAI WEIGHS IN — The clock ran out Tuesday for public comment on the Gov. Gavin Newsom-appointed AI working group’s report on the path forward for regulating the technology at the state level.\\nAI companies are using the opportunity to weigh in on the report. OpenAI’s chief global affairs officer Chris Lehane told California Decoded that in his company’s response to the report, OpenAI wants to see clear rules around “kitchen table issues,” like AI being used to harm kids and deepfakes, and to see AI education literacy beefed up as part of state education efforts.\\nBut Lehane said when it comes to California taking on stopping AI from being used to create nuclear or chemical weapons, for example: “The state doesn’t have the capacity to do it.” Wiener’s SB 1047 last year tried to do just that before its veto by Newsom resulted in the working group and its report.\\nInstead, Lehane said his company is urging the state to partner with the federal government, which he said is best equipped to do that sort of testing. “The feds have classified systems that are much better to test these systems,” Lehane said.\\nCompanies do their own “red-teaming” to test their AI models prior to release, including placing limits on what kinds of responses a chatbot will offer.\\nThat urging to work at the federal level also fits with tech companies more broadly pushing back against state-level regulation that creates a patchwork of laws companies have to handle. Federal regulations could preempt those rules when there is overlap (more on preemption later), but also might not come at all.\\nLehane said the U.S. AI Safety Institute established under the Biden administration could do some of that testing, although he admitted: “It’s likely to go through some type of transition in the Trump administration.” President Donald Trump has made a point of rolling back a Biden-era executive order on AI, as the conversation in Washington turns toward outstripping China in the AI race.\\n“California has a role to play in all of this from an economic opportunity perspective,” Lehane said, adding that “AI is a national security and economic opportunity issue” as well.\\nAsked if he supported the report’s recommendations around increasing transparency and whistleblower protections, Lehane said his company has “supported whistleblower protections in the past.”\\nBut he said: “On the transparency piece, we really need to see what the details are on that.” He added that third-party reviewers “who may not be experts” accessing sensitive systems could be an issue for companies like his.\\n“Little tech” venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz also weighed in Tuesday, recommending that third-party oversight transparency rules are not overly burdensome to smaller tech companies, and ensuring voluntary regulations do not become mandatory, among other concerns.\\nBILL WATCH: CHATBOT DEBATE — The Senate Judiciary Committee discussed three key pieces of AI legislation yesterday: state Sen. Scott Wiener’s resurrected bill from last year focusing on AI whistleblowers; and two bills from state Sen. Steven Padilla, one that would place limits on automated decision-making systems, and the other would put guardrails on chatbot programs used by young people.\\nPadilla’s chatbot bill passed through the committee with bipartisan support.\\nPadilla held a press conference Tuesday at the Capitol on his chatbots bill, which included Megan Garcia, a Florida mother who has sued Character.AI alleging its chatbot led to her son’s death by suicide.\\n“Right now these chatbots are operating in a regulatory vacuum,” Padilla said, adding his bill would require some chatbot companies to create protocols when dealing with suicidal ideation, and create a private right of action for people like Garcia.\\nThe California Chamber of Commerce and TechNet opposed the chatbot bill during the hearing, saying it could affect general-purpose AI programs and disagreed with its private right of action, among other concerns.\\nA message from Fathom:\\nPrivacy\\nFIRST IN POLITICO: DON’T SQUASH THE LAYER CAKE — California’s new top privacy cop, Tom Kemp, and New Jersey AG Matt Platkin teamed up this week to deliver a message to the House Energy and Commerce Committee: please don’t crush our data privacy laws.\\nTheir four-page letter, as we reported yesterday for Pro subscribers, comes from the state with the oldest and most robust privacy regime, California, as well as one of the latest states to enact such legislation, New Jersey, at a time when Congress is weighing measures that could preempt state law.\\nThe bicoastal duo argued federal preemption would render states helpless to respond when new technologies threaten people’s ability to safeguard their personal information — a direct rebuttal to tech industry groups pushing Congress to pass a weaker national privacy standard.\\n“State level innovation has contributed greatly to the development of baseline US privacy standards, and states must be able to continue to react and respond to new issues in real time so that regulatory development is not frozen as new technologies advance,” they wrote in the letter.\\nBut, but, but: There’s really nothing stopping the Republican-led committee from leaving Kemp and Platkin on read and siding with the tech industry. In fact, it’s probably likely: Energy and Commerce Chair Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.) already said he supports federal rules that would override state privacy frameworks.\\nA message from Fathom:\\nFathom’s Take on Private AI Governance: A Collaborative Approach\\nOne of the defining policy challenges of our era is shaping clear, effective safeguards for AI without suffocating innovation. At Fathom, we’re developing a governance model rooted in a successful history of private governance frameworks that emerged alongside groundbreaking technologies. Our approach harnesses America’s leading experts, offers crucial legal clarity, and can adapt for businesses big and small. By ensuring AI developers proactively prioritize societal safety, we balance transformative innovation with responsible oversight, accelerating adoption across the economy by reducing uncertainty and fostering trust. Curious how Fathom is shaping AI governance to protect society while unleashing its potential? Dive deeper into our innovative initiative here.\\nSocial media\\nBILL WATCH II: RATED UNHELPFUL — Meta’s recent move to replace its U.S.-based fact-checkers with a user-generated community notes system is shaping up to be ammo for California lawmakers eager to rein in tech giants.\\nAssemblymember Lowenthal put the company’s move on blast yesterday in the Assembly Judiciary Committee, arguing it shows lawmakers need to penalize platforms that roll back content moderation and put kids at risk of seeing harmful content online.\\nMeta has launched community notes on Facebook, Instagram and Threads.\\n“Meta’s announcement is just the latest in a troubling pattern among social media platforms that consistently puts child safety second to maximize profitability and shareholder value,” the Long Beach Democrat testified yesterday.\\nLowenthal for the second year in a row is pushing fines of up to $1 million per child for social media companies that harm kids through negligent content moderation practices. The Judiciary Committee approved his AB 2 yesterday on a preliminary 9-0 vote with no amendments.\\nMeta beat back a near-identical effort from Lowenthal last year, but doing so again could prove more difficult as state policymakers grow increasingly frustrated with tech companies’ approach to kids’ safety.\\nByte Sized\\n— SEIU opens new gig-economy front with California organizing bill.

A Turing Test aims to determine if a machine can exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human.\\nAutomation and AI advancements are expected to disrupt millions of jobs globally, with the rise of LLMs like ChatGPT starting to be incorporated across dozens of different industries. A large amount of research has been dedicated to predicting which types of jobs are unlikely to be replaced.\\nWhat To Know\\nAccording to an analysis by the U.S. Career Institute, jobs with face-to-face interactions are far safer than most white-collar jobs from the encroachment of AI.\\nThe study, which was published in February 2023, originally found that AI could impact as many as 300 million full-time jobs, but that health care and education workers were safest.\\nNurse practitioner topped the list of safe jobs, as it involves direct patient care, empathy and complex judgment, making it difficult to automate.\\nChoreographer, physician assistant and mental health counsellor positions also stand out, for their projected growth and reliance on human interaction, while educators also remain in demand.\\nBut Carsten Jung, head of Macroeconomics and AI at the Institute for Public Policy Research, told Newsweek that new advances could mean some counselling jobs could be under threat, and the exact extent of the impact cannot be ascertained yet.\\n\"We have passed the \\'uncanny valley\\'—where machines are eerily similar to humans - and have entered truly uncharted territory,\" Jung said. \"An increasing number of people are already using AI for companionship and therapy. Advanced AI bots on social media could forever transform online conversations.\"\\nHe added: \"We will need to decide what role we want this new type of intelligence to play in society and put in place policies to deliver this. At the moment policy is not keeping pace.\"\\nJung said that while most jobs would see some kind of change, the one with a heavy focus on face-to-face interactions would fare the best, and that green sector jobs could grow as well.\\n\"Even if AI progress stopped where it is today, it could have big impacts on the labour market. We estimate that about 59 per cent of task in the economy could be significantly assisted by today\\'s AI. Two in three white collar tasks are at risk. \\'Back office jobs\\' from personal assistants and coders to marketing workers could be the first to be hit,\" he said.\\nJung continued: \"But the labor market could evolve, with new roles being created that emphasize face-to-face interactions, including teachers, health professionals and social workers. Jobs in the green economy, which often require physical tasks could also be the source of new jobs.\"\\nJasmine Sayyari, CEO of New Generation Network and creator of Chanci AI, also highlighted the difficulty of the \"transition phase\" of AI integration, especially in STEM jobs.\\n\"The next ten years can be split into two distinct phases: transition and growth,\" Sayyari told Newsweek. \"We\\'re already deep into the transition phase. One clear signal is the rapid increase in the global SaaS industry, from around $157 billion in 2020 to approximately $250 billion today. This shows how quickly businesses are adopting AI solutions, and it\\'s reshaping the job market.\\n\"In 2024 alone, over 150,000 job cuts were recorded across 525 tech companies, while the share of roles in STEM fields has risen to 10%, a notable jump since 2010. These shifts show that AI\\'s influence on the job market is no longer a distant projection; it\\'s happening now.\"\\nLike Jung, Sayyari highlighted health and therapy as interaction-heavy areas that would still require a human face: \"The most affected sectors include software development, where tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot automate parts of coding and boost workflows. Banking, insurance, healthcare (especially diagnostics and treatment planning), manufacturing, and retail are all seeing strong AI adoption.\\n\"Less affected (for now) are roles that rely on empathy and human connection, such as nurses, doctors, therapists, counsellors, teachers, creatives, skilled trades, and social workers. Heavy industries like mining and sea work haven\\'t been disrupted much yet, but change is coming there too.\\n\"AI carries a double edge: one side brings exciting tech advancement, and the other introduces real challenges on the human front. Confusion, the need to reskill and upskill, layoffs, and the wider social impact are often ignored in mainstream conversations.\\n\"If the job market can adapt well during these first five years, the second phase could be one of real progress, both technologically and socially. As things stabilise, new job roles will emerge and the transformation of the human workforce will start to settle into a clearer structure.\"\\nWhat Happens Next?\\nAI developments are expected to improve, with industry leaders like OpenAI releasing regular updates to their LLMs.\\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\\nSlide Circle to Vote\\nTop stories\\nTrump Wants To Revive Coal.

       "   'raw_content': 'Follow Us In Real Time | twitterfacebooklinkedin\\nNo AI disclosure rules doesn\\'t mean no AI disclosures\\n| About Chris\\nlinkedin | chris-gaetano-870989232/\\nWhile the Securities and Exchange Commission has yet to issue regulations specific to artificial intelligence, that doesn\\'t mean companies are off the hook when it comes to disclosures, as the technology\\'s use can easily be slotted into existing requirements.\\nSpeaking today at a virtual conference hosted by Financial Executives International, Scott Lesmes, partner-in-charge of public company advisory and governance with law firm Morrison Foerster, noted there are many risks that come with AI, including false or misleading information, data breaches, cyberattacks, intellectual property risk and much more. He said people need to be taking these risks seriously.\\n\"These mistakes are in the real world and have had significant consequences,\" he said.\\nHe pointed to a case in which a chatbot advised small-business owners that it was legal to fire people for complaining about sexual harassment, which is absolutely not the case. He also referred to another case where a real estate company was forced to take a $300 million write-off for relying on a faulty AI algorithm for property pricing decisions, and another where an AI model used by hospitals to determine which patients are high risk and need extra care was found to be biased against Black people.\\nIncidents like these underscore the need for robust AI governance. He noted there has been a rise in companies forming cross-disciplinary AI governance committees encompassing finance, legal, product, cybersecurity, compliance and in some cases HR and marketing. Failing that, he has also seen companies add AI oversight on the duties of existing committees. While some companies have established dedicated AI departments, more commonly they have been giving AI oversight duties to their chief information security officer or other relevant C-suite positions.\\nHe noted there has been a dramatic increase in board supervision of AI, saying that in the most recent 10-K season many clients added \"Oversight of AI\" in terms of what the board was responsible for; while it was a small percentage, he was certain it was going to increase over time. He has found that many boards either designate a single AI expert who handles such matters, or they place the responsibility on either existing technology committees or (more commonly) audit committees.\\n\"There is certainly a tension; audit committees already have such a full plate, so adding another responsibility, especially with such a broad mandate, can be a little unsettling but that is where many companies are putting this, if they handle it on the board level. [The] audit committee does make some sense, because it is very focused on internal controls as well as compliance,\" he said.\\nBoards generally need to consider the legal and regulatory factors that may impact operations. As many have management frameworks for oversight, so too should there be AI frameworks for how the board fulfills these responsibilities. In executing these duties, boards need to understand the critical AI uses and risks in the company, how they integrate with business processes, what is the nature of the AI system, how the company mitigates risk, and how oversight responsibility is divided between board and management, as well as any material AI incidents.\\n\"The board does not need to know about every AI incident altogether; there needs to be a level of understanding of what\\'s important enough to share and what\\'s not. The board should understand the material incidents, how the company responded and the material impact,\" he said.\\nSEC disclosures\\nRyan Adams, another Morrison Foerster partner in the same practice area, noted that even though regulators like the Securities and Exchange Commission have yet to issue specific rules or guidance around AI, they have stressed the importance of complying with existing obligations, which may or may include disclosures regarding the company\\'s use of AI and its impact, particularly where it concerns business operations. Already companies need to report material risks and changes in their filings, and as AI further embeds itself into the global economy, it will almost certainly be a factor.\\nFurther, companies should not be making false claims or misleading potential investors in general, and this applies to AI as well. Adams noted that the government has been especially interested in \"AI washing,\" that is exaggerating, or making false claims about the company\\'s AI capabilities or use. He pointed to one example where the SEC brought charges against the CEO and founder of a startup who said the company had a proprietary AI system that could help clients find job candidates from diverse backgrounds, but this AI did not, in fact, exist. Adams pointed out that this didn\\'t even involve a public company, just a private one that was trying to raise investment capital.\\n\"So it makes clear that the SEC will scrutinize all AI-related claims made by any company, public or private, trying to get investors to raise capital,\" he said.\\nHe added that AI washing can be thought of as similar to inflating financial results or just making up the numbers entirely. Just as an entity should not overstate the capacities of its AI systems, the same has applies to automation technology in general. Regulators want clear and candid disclosures about how a company uses AI and how it presents material risks. In this regard, Adams warned against generic or boilerplate disclosures regarding AI.\\n\"Regardless of the type of company you are, you have to take this seriously. Anyone touting the benefits of AI with customers or the public needs to make sure what they say is truthful and accurate and can be substantiated, or risk potential legal consequences,\" he said.\\nIt is important to keep materiality in mind. Neither investors nor regulators want to read a list of every conceivable AI-related risk a company faces when only one or two are relevant. Adams conceded this might require slightly different thinking, as accountants tend to lean on quantitative factors to assess materiality, but AI can also carry qualitatively material factors as well.\\nSome of the examples of risk that he mentioned include:\\n\"You could go on forever with these AI risks …\\xa0 Just because you use AI and a risk is potential does not necessarily mean disclosure is appropriate. You need to spend time thinking about whether AI-related risks are appropriate to disclose and, if they are, they should be narrowly tailored to describe the material risk,\" said Adams.\\xa0When assessing materiality, he said to go with the same standard accountants have been using for ages: Is there a substantial likelihood a reasonable investor would consider this information important to determine whether to buy, sell or hold a security? Where AI introduces a slight wrinkle is that, given the pace of change in the field, it is important for companies to review and reevaluate their risk factors every quarter.\\nBut risks are not the only things one should disclose. Adams noted that companies should also consider AI impacts when drafting management discussion and analysis or the executive overview, pointing out major developments, initiatives or milestones related to the technology. AI could also come up in discussions of capital expenditures. If the entity made big AI investments that are material and known to the business, that needs to be disclosed. Another area AI plays into is cybersecurity disclosures, which already involve a number of SEC requirements. The two topics, he said, often go hand in hand, so if AI interacts with cybersecurity in any way, it might be worth disclosing.\\nOverall, Adams recommended that companies:\\nWhile the current administration has emphasized a less regulated approach to AI, Adams noted that the SEC is still active in its dialogues with the business community around potential regulation, mentioning a recent meeting with the investment advisor community as well as a strategy roundtable with the financial services community.\\n\"The big takeaway here is that both the SEC and industry are saying, \\'We want to have active and ongoing communications as this develops\\' … Any regulations we do see, if any, in the future [will be] informed by what is actually happening in the marketplace,\" he said.\\n$20 million questions; speared; tag, you\\'re it; and other highlights of recent tax cases.\\nThough the SEC has yet to issue regulations specific to AI, that doesn\\'t mean companies are off the hook when it comes to disclosures.\\nThe two Top 25 Firms are reportedly close to a major M&A deal, which would create a firm with $3 billion in annual revenue.\\nStates are looking to add new pathways to CPA licensure, beyond the 150-credit requirement, amid an ongoing labor shortage.\\nRegistrations are open for the 2025 Accounting MOVE Project, with a focus on the cost of losing talent and how belonging impacts retention and growth.\\nAs AI works its way into more and more business processes, it has become increasingly important for auditors to understand where, why, when and how organizations use it and what impact it is having.\\nAccounting Today is a leading provider of online business news for the accounting community, offering breaking news, in-depth features, and a host of resources and services.\\nFollow Us In Real Time\\ngooglenewstwitterapplenewsfacebooklinkedin'}],\n",

       "   'raw_content': 'Sam Altman\\'s lawyers roast Elon Musk in scorching new court filing\\nIf you let Sam Altman\\'s lawyers tell it, Elon Musk\\'s ongoing battle against OpenAI stems from his personal vendetta against Altman and OpenAI —\\xa0a company that has seen its business boom since it refused to cede control to Musk in 2018.\\nIn a Wednesday filing related to Musk\\'s August 2024 lawsuit against OpenAI, lawyers for Altman and the company laid out Altman\\'s version of events that led to the breakup between the two tech titans. It has been the most detailed account thus far of Altman\\'s side of what went down in his fight with Musk.\\n\"Musk could not tolerate seeing such success for an enterprise he had abandoned and declared doomed,\" the filing read. \"He made it his project to take down OpenAI, and to build a direct competitor that would seize the technological lead—not for humanity but for Elon Musk.\"\\nThe filing continued: \"The ensuing campaign has been relentless. Through press attacks, malicious campaigns broadcast to Musk\\'s more than 200 million followers on the social media platform he controls, a pretextual demand for corporate records, harassing legal claims, and a sham bid for OpenAI\\'s assets, Musk has tried every tool available to harm OpenAI.\"\\nOpenAI\\'s filing on Wednesday came the same day the judge in the case set a March 2026 trial date in this clash of titans lawsuit. The company\\'s lawyers did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\\nOpenAI said it was counter-suing Musk in a scathing series of X posts published on Wednesday. The ChatGPT maker also pointed to older blog posts it had published on their pivot from a nonprofit approach as well as their email exchanges with Musk.\\n\"Elon\\'s nonstop actions against us are just bad-faith tactics to slow down OpenAI and seize control of the leading AI innovations for his personal benefit,\" OpenAI wrote on X on Wednesday.\\n\"Elon\\'s never been about the mission. He\\'s always had his own agenda. He tried to seize control of OpenAI and merge it with Tesla as a for-profit — his own emails prove it. When he didn\\'t get his way, he stormed off,\" the company added.\\nRepresentatives for OpenAI referred BI to its recent X posts and the Wednesday filing when contacted for comment.\\nMusk cofounded OpenAI with Altman in 2015 but left the company\\'s board in 2018. Musk said in 2019 that he left because Tesla was competing for the same talent as OpenAI. Musk said he also \"didn\\'t agree with some of what the OpenAI team wanted to do. Musk did not specify what those differences were.\\nSince then, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO has been a vocal critic of Altman\\'s leadership of OpenAI. Musk had initially filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in February 2024 but withdrew it in June. He later refiled the lawsuit in August.\\nIn his lawsuit, Musk accused OpenAI of violating its nonprofit mission by partnering with Microsoft. Musk\\'s lawyers argued that OpenAI\\'s executives \"deceived\" him into cofounding the company by playing on his fears about AI\\'s existential risks.\\nIn February, an Elon-Musk-led investor group made a $97.4 billion bid for OpenAI. Altman dismissed Musk\\'s unsolicited takeover bid.\\n\"The company is not for sale, neither is the mission,\" Altman said of Musk\\'s bid in an interview with Sky News in February.\\nMusk did not respond to a request for comment from BI.\\nRecommended video\\nRead next\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nJump to'},\n",

       "   'raw_content': 'Elon Musk wants to be “AGI dictator,” OpenAI tells court\\nElon Musk’s “relentless” attacks on OpenAI must cease, court filing says.\\nYesterday, OpenAI counter-sued Elon Musk, alleging that Musk\\'s \"sham\" bid to buy OpenAI was intentionally timed to maximally disrupt and potentially even frighten off investments from honest bidders.\\nSlamming Musk for attempting to become an \"AGI dictator,\" OpenAI said that if Musk\\'s allegedly \"relentless\" yearslong campaign of \"harassment\" isn’t stopped, Musk could end up taking over OpenAI and tanking its revenue the same way he did with Twitter.\\nIn its filing, OpenAI argued that Musk and the other investors who joined his bid completely fabricated the $97.375 billion offer. It was allegedly not based on OpenAI\\'s projections or historical performance, like Musk claimed, but instead appeared to be \"a comedic reference to Musk’s favorite sci-fi\" novel, Iain Banks\\' Look to Windward. Musk and others also provided \"no evidence of financing to pay the nearly $100 billion purchase price,\" OpenAI said.\\nAnd perhaps most damning, one of Musk\\'s backers, Ron Baron, appeared \"flustered\" when asked about the deal on CNBC, OpenAI alleged. On air, Baron admitted that he didn\\'t follow the deal closely and that \"the point of the bid, as pitched to him (plainly by Musk) was not to buy OpenAI’s assets, but instead to obtain \\'discovery\\' and get \\'behind the wall\\' at OpenAI,\" the AI company\\'s court filing alleged.\\nLikely poisoning potential deals most, OpenAI suggested, was the idea that Musk might take over OpenAI and damage its revenue like he did with Twitter. Just the specter of that could repel talent, OpenAI feared, since \"the prospect of a Musk takeover means chaos and arbitrary employment action.\"\\nAnd \"still worse, the threat of a Musk takeover is a threat to the very mission of building beneficial AGI,\" since xAI is allegedly \"the worst offender\" in terms of \"inadequate safety measures,\" according to one study, and X\\'s chatbot, Grok, has \"become a leading spreader of misinformation and inflammatory political rhetoric,\" OpenAI said. Even xAI representatives had to admit that users discovering that Grok consistently responds that \"President Donald Trump and Musk deserve the death penalty\" was a \"really terrible and bad failure,\" OpenAI\\'s filing said.\\nDespite Musk appearing to only be \"pretending\" to be interested in purchasing OpenAI—and OpenAI ultimately rejecting the offer—the company still had to cover the costs of reviewing the bid. And beyond bearing costs and confronting an artificially raised floor on the company\\'s valuation supposedly frightening off investors, \"a more serious toll\" of \"Musk\\'s most recent ploy\" would be OpenAI lacking resources to fulfill its mission to benefit humanity with AI \"on terms uncorrupted by unlawful harassment and interference,\" OpenAI said.\\nOpenAI has demanded a jury trial and is seeking an injunction to stop Musk\\'s alleged unfair business practices—which they claimed are designed to impair competition in the nascent AI field \"for the sole benefit of Musk’s xAI\" and \"at the expense of the public interest.\"\\n\"The risk of future, irreparable harm from Musk’s unlawful conduct is acute, and the risk that that conduct continues is high,\" OpenAI alleged. \"With every month that has passed, Musk has intensified and expanded the fronts of his campaign against OpenAI, and has proven himself willing to take ever more dramatic steps to seek a competitive advantage for xAI and to harm [OpenAI CEO Sam] Altman, whom, in the words of the president of the United States, Musk \\'hates.\\'\"\\nOpenAI also wants Musk to cover the costs it incurred from entertaining the supposedly fake bid, as well as pay punitive damages to be determined at trial for allegedly engaging \"in wrongful conduct with malice, oppression, and fraud.\"\\nOpenAI\\'s filing also largely denies Musk\\'s claims that OpenAI abandoned its mission and made a fool out of early investors like Musk by currently seeking to restructure its core business into a for-profit benefit corporation (which removes control by its nonprofit board).\\n\"You can’t sue your way to AGI,\" an OpenAI blog said.\\nMusk\\'s lawyer did not immediately respond to Ars\\' request for comment.\\nMusk’s attempt to become an “AGI dictator”\\nAccording to OpenAI\\'s filing, \"Musk has tried every tool available to harm OpenAI\" ever since OpenAI refused to allow Musk to become an \"AGI dictator\" and fully control OpenAI by absorbing it into Tesla in 2018.\\nMusk allegedly \"demanded sole control of the new for-profit, at least in the short term: He would be CEO, own a majority equity stake, and control a majority of the board,\" OpenAI said. \"He would—in his own words—\\'unequivocally have initial control of the company.\\'\"\\nAt the time, OpenAI rejected Musk\\'s offer, viewing it as in conflict with its mission to avoid corporate control and telling Musk:\\n\"You stated that you don’t want to control the final AGI, but during this negotiation, you’ve shown to us that absolute control is extremely important to you. ... The goal of OpenAI is to make the future good and to avoid an AGI dictatorship. ... So it is a bad idea to create a structure where you could become a dictator if you chose to, especially given that we can create some other structure that avoids this possibility.”\\nThis news did not sit well with Musk, OpenAI said.\\n\"Musk was incensed,\" OpenAI told the court. \"If he could not control the contemplated for-profit entity, he would not participate in it.\"\\nBack then, Musk departed from OpenAI somewhat \"amicably,\" OpenAI said, although Musk insisted it was \"obvious\" that OpenAI would fail without him. However, after OpenAI instead became a global AI leader, Musk quietly founded xAI, OpenAI alleged, failing to publicly announce his new company while deceptively seeking a \"moratorium\" on AI development, apparently to slow down rivals so that xAI could catch up.\\nOpenAI also alleges that this is when Musk began intensifying his attacks on OpenAI while attempting to poach its top talent and demanding access to OpenAI\\'s confidential, sensitive information as a former donor and director—\"without ever disclosing he was building a competitor in secret.\"\\nAnd the attacks have only grown more intense since then, said OpenAI, claiming that Musk planted stories in the media, wielded his influence on X, requested government probes into OpenAI, and filed multiple legal claims, including seeking an injunction to halt OpenAI\\'s business.\\n\"Most explosively,\" OpenAI alleged that Musk pushed attorneys general of California and Delaware \"to force OpenAI, Inc., without legal basis, to auction off its assets for the benefit of Musk and his associates.\"\\nMeanwhile, OpenAI noted, Musk has folded his social media platform X into xAI, announcing its valuation was at $80 billion and gaining \"a major competitive advantage\" by getting \"unprecedented direct access to all the user data flowing through\" X. Further, Musk intends to expand his \"Colossus,\" which is \"believed to be the world’s largest supercomputer,\" \"tenfold.\" That could help Musk \"leap ahead\" of OpenAI, suggesting Musk has motive to delay OpenAI\\'s growth while he pursues that goal.\\nThat\\'s why Musk \"set in motion a campaign of harassment, interference, and misinformation designed to take down OpenAI and clear the field for himself,\" OpenAI alleged.\\nEven while counter-suing, OpenAI appears careful not to poke the bear too hard. In the court filing and on X, OpenAI praised Musk\\'s leadership skills and the potential for xAI to dominate the AI industry, partly due to its unique access to X data. But ultimately, OpenAI seems to be happy to be operating independently of Musk now, asking the court to agree that \"Elon’s never been about the mission\" of benefiting humanity with AI, \"he’s always had his own agenda.\"\\n\"Elon is undoubtedly one of the greatest entrepreneurs of our time,\" OpenAI said on X. \"But these antics are just history on repeat—Elon being all about Elon.\"\\nArs Technica has been separating the signal from\\nthe noise for over 25 years.

And there’s a good chance that it will be one made by Brinc Drones, a Seattle-based startup founded by 25-year-old Blake Resnick, who dropped out of college to run the company.\\nBrinc, which was founded in 2017 and counts OpenAI CEO Sam Altman as a seed-stage investor, just announced today that it has raised $75 million in new funding led by Index Ventures.\\nThis brings the startup’s total funding to $157.2 million. While Brinc isn’t disclosing its exact valuation, Resnick told TechCrunch it’s an “up-round” compared to its most recent round, a $55 million Series B in 2022. Brinc was last valued at $300 million in 2023, Bloomberg reported.\\nBrinc sells a variety of drone systems to police and public safety agencies. It’s part of a broader trend of U.S. drone startups manufacturing domestically due to increasing restrictions against Chinese companies that dominate the commercial drone industry. (Resnick briefly interned at DJI, by far the biggest Chinese player, a few years before founding Brinc.)\\nWith this funding, Brinc is launching a “strategic alliance” with Motorola Solutions, which also invested in the round. Motorola Solutions is a giant in the U.S. security industry whose software powers many 911 call centers. The partnership will integrate Brinc drones directly into those centers, allowing operators to dispatch drones for certain emergency calls if they’re cleared by an existing Motorola AI system.\\nBrinc is, however, in an increasingly competitive field with other U.S. startups like Flock Safety and Skydio. Each also offers drones for police, and have multibillion-dollar valuations. Flock stood at $7.5 billion in its latest round last month while Skydio was valued at $2.2 billion in 2023.\\nWhen it comes to the competition, Resnick tells TechCrunch that there’s plenty of room for growth in a market that is otherwise dominated by Chinese players. Beyond the Motorola partnership, he says Brinc offers its share of unique features, like the ability to break windows or deliver emergency medical devices.\\nTopics\\nSenior Reporter\\nMost Popular\\nInside the EV startup secretly backed by Jeff Bezos\\nInside the EV startup secretly backed by Jeff Bezos\\nIBM releases a new mainframe built for the age of AI\\nIBM releases a new mainframe built for the age of AI\\nGoogle is allegedly paying some AI staff to do nothing for a year rather than join rivals\\nGoogle is allegedly paying some AI staff to do nothing for a year rather than join rivals\\nMicrosoft reportedly fires staff whose protest interrupted its Copilot event\\nMicrosoft reportedly fires staff whose protest interrupted its Copilot event\\nHow one tweet wreaked havoc on the stock market\\nHow one tweet wreaked havoc on the stock market\\nShopify CEO tells teams to consider using AI before growing headcount\\nShopify CEO tells teams to consider using AI before growing headcount\\nMeta’s benchmarks for its new AI models are a bit misleading\\nMeta’s benchmarks for its new AI models are a bit misleading\\n© 2025 Yahoo.'},\n",

       "   'raw_content': 'Sam Altman\\'s lawyers roast Elon Musk in scorching new court filing\\nIf you let Sam Altman\\'s lawyers tell it, Elon Musk\\'s ongoing battle against OpenAI stems from his personal vendetta against Altman and OpenAI —\\xa0a company that has seen its business boom since it refused to cede control to Musk in 2018.\\nIn a Wednesday filing related to Musk\\'s August 2024 lawsuit against OpenAI, lawyers for Altman and the company laid out Altman\\'s version of events that led to the breakup between the two tech titans. It has been the most detailed account thus far of Altman\\'s side of what went down in his fight with Musk.\\n\"Musk could not tolerate seeing such success for an enterprise he had abandoned and declared doomed,\" the filing read. \"He made it his project to take down OpenAI, and to build a direct competitor that would seize the technological lead—not for humanity but for Elon Musk.\"\\nThe filing continued: \"The ensuing campaign has been relentless. Through press attacks, malicious campaigns broadcast to Musk\\'s more than 200 million followers on the social media platform he controls, a pretextual demand for corporate records, harassing legal claims, and a sham bid for OpenAI\\'s assets, Musk has tried every tool available to harm OpenAI.\"\\nOpenAI\\'s filing on Wednesday came the same day the judge in the case set a March 2026 trial date in this clash of titans lawsuit. The company\\'s lawyers did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\\nOpenAI said it was counter-suing Musk in a scathing series of X posts published on Wednesday. The ChatGPT maker also pointed to older blog posts it had published on their pivot from a nonprofit approach as well as their email exchanges with Musk.\\n\"Elon\\'s nonstop actions against us are just bad-faith tactics to slow down OpenAI and seize control of the leading AI innovations for his personal benefit,\" OpenAI wrote on X on Wednesday.\\n\"Elon\\'s never been about the mission. He\\'s always had his own agenda. He tried to seize control of OpenAI and merge it with Tesla as a for-profit — his own emails prove it. When he didn\\'t get his way, he stormed off,\" the company added.\\nRepresentatives for OpenAI referred BI to its recent X posts and the Wednesday filing when contacted for comment.\\nMusk cofounded OpenAI with Altman in 2015 but left the company\\'s board in 2018. Musk said in 2019 that he left because Tesla was competing for the same talent as OpenAI. Musk said he also \"didn\\'t agree with some of what the OpenAI team wanted to do. Musk did not specify what those differences were.\\nSince then, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO has been a vocal critic of Altman\\'s leadership of OpenAI. Musk had initially filed a lawsuit against OpenAI in February 2024 but withdrew it in June. He later refiled the lawsuit in August.\\nIn his lawsuit, Musk accused OpenAI of violating its nonprofit mission by partnering with Microsoft. Musk\\'s lawyers argued that OpenAI\\'s executives \"deceived\" him into cofounding the company by playing on his fears about AI\\'s existential risks.\\nIn February, an Elon-Musk-led investor group made a $97.4 billion bid for OpenAI. Altman dismissed Musk\\'s unsolicited takeover bid.\\n\"The company is not for sale, neither is the mission,\" Altman said of Musk\\'s bid in an interview with Sky News in February.\\nMusk did not respond to a request for comment from BI.\\nRecommended video\\nRead next\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nBusiness Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know\\nJump to'},\n",

Tons of stuff for you today, including Nintendo’s Switch 2; capacity issues at OpenAI; a story that deserves the Hollywood treatment; and much, much more. Let’s go!\\nIt’s finally (almost) here: After almost 10 years, Nintendo finally released its Switch successor, the Switch 2. According to TechCrunch’s Amanda Silberling, the $450 system “tries to take a console that’s already beloved and simply just make it better.” I’m into that! Unfortunately, preorders in the U.S. might be delayed in response to Trump’s tariffs.\\nDelays, delays: OpenAI’s Sam Altman said in a series of posts on X that the company’s new image-generating tool could cause unspecified product delays. “Working as fast [as] we can to really get stuff humming,” Altman wrote. The company promises it’ll release o3 (after effectively canceling the consumer release back in February).\\nThe old college try: Zach Yadegari, who built the viral Cal AI app, wrote on twitter that even though he has a 4.0 GPA and a $30 million ARR company, he still wasn’t accepted into 15 top universities.\\nThis is TechCrunch’s Week in Review, where we recap the week’s biggest news. Want this delivered as a newsletter to your inbox every Saturday? Sign up here.\\nNews\\nOh no: The Trump administration fired the head of the National Security Agency and Cyber Command, as well as the NSA’s deputy director, who served as the agency’s top civilian leader. It’s not clear who is currently overseeing the NSA and Cyber Command following the firing.\\nDo my shopping for me, please: Amazon on Monday unveiled Nova Act, a general-purpose AI agent that can take control of a web browser and independently perform some simple actions. Amazon is testing a feature it calls “Buy for Me” — powered by its Nova AI models — which shows users third-party sites that have products they may want. They can then buy things off those other sites, without leaving Amazon’s site. Pretty nifty!\\nYikes: One nefarious use for ChatGPT’s new image generator: faking receipts. People are already using it to generate fake restaurant receipts, potentially adding another tool to the already-extensive toolkit of AI deepfakes used by fraudsters. The receipts generated can even include food and coffee stains to make them look more authentic. Great!\\nA tale of two companies: Rippling announced in March that it was suing rival Deel for alleged spying, and this week released the affidavit of the Rippling employee who testified that he was working as a spy. It’s got some juicy details, like people representing Deel allegedly telling him to smash his “old phone with an axe.” Hollywood, are you listening?\\nPointing fingers: Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney called out Apple and Google for their “gangster-style” business practices. You might remember that his company sued both Apple and Google for monopolistic practices over their respective app stores. Epic won its case with Google but not with Apple.\\nWe hardly knew ye: Zelle, which facilitates person-to-person payments, said Tuesday that it’s shutting down its app. But don’t be alarmed: Of the 150 million people who use Zelle, only 2% of transactions were made via the stand-alone app, rather than via the bank. OK, that makes sense, then.\\nSpeaking of banks: Plaid, which connects bank accounts to financial applications, sold about $575 million worth of common stock at a $6.1 billion post-money valuation. The valuation is about less than half of the $13.4 billion that San Francisco-based Plaid was valued at when it raised a $425 million Series D in April 2021.\\nPower hungry: New and expanded data centers are expected to double the AI sector’s power demand by 2029. As a result, developers and tech companies have been working overtime to lock in capacity. And that’s where the sun comes in.\\nAnalysis\\nBacksliding: Elon Musk’s push into politics — specifically his alignment with President Trump and activities within the federal government — has dragged Tesla into uncertainty. For proof, just look at the company’s disappointing first-quarter delivery numbers. The question now is whether the Tesla brand can recover.\\nTopics\\nDeputy Managing Editor\\nKaryne Levy is the deputy managing editor of TechCrunch.

Listen now to understand the real potential beyond the buzzwords.\\nBelow is an excerpt from the podcast:\\nThere's no doubt about it, artificial intelligence is really shaping this decade. It's popping up everywhere, across practically every industry, making things more convenient and opening doors we probably haven't even thought of yet. Now, for manufacturing, we've already seen huge leaps in efficiency thanks to Industry 4.0 and automation, right? Well, AI is really the next big wave. In fact, Tom Coshow over at Gartner predicts that by 2028, AI agents—not people—will be making about 15% of routine business decisions all on their own.\\nThat's a huge shift, especially for manufacturing. But to really grasp how AI will achieve this on the factory floor, we first need to get clear on what we mean by 'AI'. It's not just one thing. You've probably heard terms like 'Generative AI' and 'Agentic AI' thrown around, alongside the machine learning many are already familiar with. Let's break down what these different types are and how they fit into the manufacturing picture.\\nSo the big terms you keep hearing are Generative AI and Agentic AI. And it's important to know they're not the same thing.\\nBefore these newer types hit the headlines, many in manufacturing were already using AI, specifically machine learning. Think of machine learning as being focused mostly on prediction—it looks at data, finds patterns, and uses rules we give it to solve specific problems. You see it in predictive analytics, understanding language—that's natural language processing or NLP—and even some basic autonomous systems.\\nThen you have Generative AI. It also learns from data, but its main job is to create something new based on those patterns. This is the AI that writes text, generates images, maybe even composes music, or designs product models. Think ChatGPT, Claude, DALL-E, Midjourney—those tools that exploded onto the scene? That's Generative AI. It's great for mimicking human-like creative work and can be a real time-saver.\\nTom Coshow over at Gartner predicts that by 2028, AI agents—not people—will be making about 15% of routine business decisions all on their own.\\nNow, Agentic AI is built to interact with the world around it, make decisions, and actually do things to reach a goal—all by itself, no human constantly telling it what to do. That's a key difference from Generative AI, which usually needs a human prompt to get started.\\nFor Agentic AI, think about a self-driving car figuring out traffic based on its sensors, or a robot arm in a warehouse picking and sorting items on its own, or even a smart assistant that manages your calendar without you asking. These systems use sensors to 'see' or 'feel' their surroundings, algorithms to 'think,' and actuators to 'act'.\\nThe core idea with Agentic AI is that it has a goal. It doesn't just react; it considers its objectives and makes choices to get there. This is the type of AI people sometimes joke about taking over because it can act independently. That independence naturally brings up serious questions about ethics and accountability. Like, who's responsible if it messes up? How do we ensure it stays aligned with what we want it to do? Developers are definitely grappling with this, building in safeguards to keep things on track.\\nSo, another way to think about the difference is scope. Generative AI is usually focused on specific, well-defined creative tasks. Agentic AI often tackles bigger, more complex goals that might require multiple steps and constant adjustments along the way. The simple takeaway? Generative AI generates, Agentic AI acts.\\nKeep listening\\nSo, remember that key difference: Generative AI generates, Agentic AI acts. And often, as we'll see, they can even work together. With that foundation laid, let's explore the interesting part: what does this look like in practice today? Where is AI already making a tangible impact on the manufacturing floor?\\nWhen you start combining AI—whether it's machine learning, generative, or agentic—with things like computer vision or natural language processing, you can speed up process improvements like never before. One of its superpowers is crunching massive amounts of data. And I don't just mean looking at numbers—I mean digging through everything, finding hidden patterns, learning constantly, figuring out what it all means, and then telling you what to do next, or even doing it itself, often in seconds. Plus, it's adaptable. Because it's based on algorithms, it can react to changes happening right now—data pouring in from sensors, machines, maybe your whole production line.\\nAbout the PodcastGreat Question: A Manufacturing Podcast offers news and information for the people who make, store and move things and those who manage and maintain the facilities where that work gets done.

There is an expanding ecosystem of AI-native startups, accelerating enterprise adoption, and the unmistakable reality that organisations failing to adapt risk obsolescence.\\nHere’s the big statistic to go with it: 92 per cent of CIOs believe that AI will be implemented in their organisations by the end of 2025. Being one of those eight per cent that aren’t working with AI is going to start looking like how it must have to those organisations that still held on to their typewriters for too long.\\nFor established companies like nCino, the imperative here is clear. Staying relevant means rethinking foundations and rebuilding with AI embedded throughout the organisation, right across strategy, culture, and people, and it’s not an incremental change; this is a story of transformation.\\nStrategy First: AI Is Not a Silo\\nThe most common misstep companies make when approaching AI is creating a standalone \"AI strategy.\" This siloed thinking inevitably leads to technology adoption for its own sake, resulting in scattered experiments that fail to deliver meaningful business outcomes.\\nLeading organisations understand that AI must be embedded within their core business strategy, not alongside it. Netflix doesn\\'t have an AI strategy separate from its mission to entertain the world. AI simply amplifies how effectively they deliver personalised content. Similarly, Jordan Brand leverages AI to strengthen its connection with sneaker culture, and nCino uses it to rethink banking in financial services.\\nThe integration of AI into business strategy necessitates an elevated focus on data. With AI, data is no longer just a record of past performance but the fuel that powers future capabilities. Organisations that recognise this shift are investing heavily in data infrastructure, governance, and literacy across teams. As nCino has demonstrated, when data strategy becomes inseparable from business strategy, AI can transform customer experiences and operational workflows in ways previously unimaginable.\\nInnovation Culture: From Theory to Action\\nThe gap between AI aspirations and results remains stubbornly wide for many organisations. Despite increased spending — particularly in the banking sector — many institutions report disappointing returns on their AI investments.\\nGartner’s prediction that 30% of AI projects will be abandoned after the POC stage is looking pretty accurate, and mirrors the challenges that organisations have had with transformative technologies in the past.\\nIt’s not technical capability that’s making AI adoption difficult, however. The difference between success and failure often comes down to culture.\\nCompanies succeeding with AI foster environments where teams can experiment, fail fast, and quickly incorporate learnings. They recognise that perseverance through initial setbacks is essential for breakthrough results.\\nThis cultural shift extends to process as well. Development cycles that once stretched across months or years must compress to match AI\\'s capabilities. The evolution is clear: from waterfall methodologies to agile frameworks and now to even more dynamic, AI-accelerated development cycles. Companies like nCino are adapting their processes accordingly, enabling faster ideation-to-implementation timelines while maintaining necessary controls.\\nHumans at the Helm: Empowering the Workforce\\nPerhaps the most pernicious myth about AI is that it eliminates the need for human involvement. The reality is more nuanced: AI doesn\\'t replace people—it transforms the roles they play.\\nHuman judgement, ethical considerations, and critical thinking become even more valuable in an AI-enabled organisation. Consider the cautionary tale of a startup founder who built an application entirely with AI, bypassing human oversight of security protocols, and then focused more on building the company than the application. The result was a spectacular (to say the least) crash.\\nWorking with AI successfully on any level – whether to support the business or as the product the business sells - depends on upskilling people and embedding accountability across teams. This means investing in training programmes that help employees understand not just how to use AI tools but when and why to apply them. It means creating clear governance frameworks that delineate responsibilities for AI outcomes. And it means fostering a culture where humans and machines collaborate rather than compete.\\nThe companies that thrive in this new era will be those that view AI not as a technological add-on but as a fundamental reshaping of how they operate. They\\'ll integrate AI into their strategic foundations, foster cultures of practical innovation, and empower their workforces to leverage these new capabilities effectively.\\nTo be sure, it is a challenge as well as an opportunity. But given that AI isn’t optional, the best time to start grappling with this challenge was yesterday.\\nGot a news tip for our journalists?

       "   'raw_content': \"Helping Biomanufacturers Overcome Resistance to Modern Automation\\nEmerging AI-based technologies are galvanizing a new generation of data-driven machinery in the biopharmaceutical industry\\nBy\\nChris Sandusky\\nCredit: Ivan Bajic/Getty Images\\nAutomation has a long history of driving enhanced production. During the Industrial Revolution, manufacturers first harnessed automated machines to increase yields for materials like cotton and paper. Decades later, the rapid expansion of the automobile industry in the early 20th century saw automotive companies streamline assembly lines, reducing assembly time from 12 hours to about 1.5 hours per car.\\nToday, robotic process automation plays a pivotal role in the life sciences industry. AI-powered technologies like machine learning have rejuvenated automation, enabling data-driven machines to control and interact with each other autonomously. Many industries are moving towards this goal. While these benefits are something for which they strive, greater quality and consistency are even more critical in the strictly regulated biopharma sector. So why has biopharma and the wider pharmaceutical industry been slower to adopt fully automated technologies?\\nComplex and variable\\nComplex and variable\\nThe complexity and variability of bioprocessing are often cited as the main reason for the lag in uptake. However, success stories such as Moderna, which utilized automation and AI to develop an mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine within a year, show it is achievable, without risking the quality and consistency that is so important to therapeutic manufacturing. Even with this compelling story, some firms opt for less-integrated options because they are simpler to deploy initially and align better to their current timelines, workforce, and budget.\\nThe limited duration of patent protection is also a factor. Making major changes to a licensed facility can be challenging and time consuming. Once a facility is licensed to manufacture a biologics product, there likely won’t be multiple changes, and overhauling an entire factory can be cost prohibitive.\\nAdditionally, there are different pressures on the biologics industry. For example, technology advancements are pivotal in reducing costs in the automotive industry. In the biopharmaceutical sector, the priority is on delivering products that maintain high quality, consistency, and reasonable pricing.\\nBecause of the risk in changing a facility, automation is often considered in the design of new facilities. Modern biopharma facilities are constructed to be multipurpose, handling different products or production campaigns. Automation enables flexibility, allowing seamless transitions between different product lines without extensive manual reconfiguration. Automated systems can adapt quickly to different process parameters, making facilities more agile and future-proofing their operations.\\nDespite the advantages of automation, there are potential challenges to consider. Implementing fully automated systems can take time. Changeover times may present issues depending on how flexibly you’ve designed your systems and the facility to handle changes and multiple products. Legacy systems must be considered as many biopharma companies still rely on outdated, manual systems and integrating automation with these legacy systems can be expensive and technically challenging.\\nThe data that automated systems generate needs to be integrated into existing data management and quality control systems. The transition from paper-based or manual tracking to automated digital systems can be slow and met with resistance.\\nManufacturers may encounter difficulties when they adopt technology without clear objectives. However, aiming for continuous improvement of manufacturing processes is a clear and achievable objective. By consistently using technology to enhance processes and optimizing human and capital resources, manufacturers can achieve remarkable success.\\nChris Sandusky is director, automation solutions, product & lifecycle management, Cytiva.\\nPodcast Series\\nTouching Base\\nTouching Base is the dynamic podcast series from the editors of GEN.\\nEach episode features a rotating case of senior editors—including John Sterling, Kevin Davies, Julianna\\nLeMieux, Alex Phillippidis, Uduak Thomas, Corinna Singleman, and Fay Lin—who delve into emerging stories,\\nexchange ideas, and debate the latest trends in biotech.

       "   'raw_content': \"| Welcome to Global Village Space\\nAltman defends AI art amid Ghibli backlash\\nAltman defends AI art, calling it a 'net win' for society, amid backlash over Ghibli-style images and job displacement concerns.\\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman has responded to the growing backlash over AI-generated art, particularly the viral trend of Studio Ghibli-style images created using GPT-4o, calling the broader impact of the technology “a big net win for society.” His remarks, made during a podcast interview with Indian entrepreneur Varun Mayya, address rising concerns about artistic theft, job displacement, and the future of creative industries.\\nAI-Ghibli Trend Sparks Online Uproar\\nThe controversy erupted after OpenAI integrated native image generation into ChatGPT via its GPT-4o model. Soon after the feature went live, the internet was flooded with AI-generated images mimicking the distinctive hand-drawn style of Japan’s iconic animation house, Studio Ghibli. While Ghibli itself has not commented, an old clip of co-founder Hayao Miyazaki resurfaced, in which he described a computer-generated animation experiment as “an insult to life itself.” The video reignited debates about the ethical and legal boundaries of AI art. Altman responded to the criticism by acknowledging the harm AI can cause, but insisted that the overall outcome remains positive. “There are negative things about it for sure… but on the whole, it’s been a win,” he said.\\nRead More: Elon Musk says xAI startup buying X platform\\n‘Democratising Creativity’\\nAltman framed AI-generated art as a technological leap that lowers barriers to entry in creative work. “Giving everyone more tools, making things easier, lowering the barriers to entry, does significantly increase the number of people that can contribute to society,” he said. He compared the present AI wave to earlier shifts that allowed smaller players to enter tech, noting that OpenAI itself would not have existed if such changes hadn’t occurred.\\nHowever, he conceded that this democratization isn’t without cost. “It doesn’t mean that it [AI art] doesn’t cause some job loss,” Altman admitted. “Some people who had a sort of differential ability to do something now have a lot more competition.”\\xa0 Critics argue that AI models have been trained on artists’ original work without consent, creating tools that now compete with the very creators they learned from. This issue, they say, cuts to the heart of the AI art debate.\\nCoding, Productivity, and Job Shifts\\nBeyond art, Altman discussed how AI could reshape the broader job market. “It’ll be different for different kinds of jobs,” he said. While some roles may disappear entirely, others will be enhanced. “Mostly, I think it’ll be a case of a new tool where people are just much more productive.” He believes coders could become “10 times more productive” within a year or two, though he warned this may reduce the market value of individual tasks due to increased output — a dynamic he likened to Jevons Paradox.\\nIndia Emerges as a Key AI Hub\\nAltman also highlighted India as OpenAI’s fastest-growing market. “India was one of the first markets outside the US that really jumped on AI in a huge, huge way,” he said.

Among the new AI models will be a release of what I’m expecting will be branded GPT-4.1, which one source describes as a revamped version of OpenAI’s GPT-4o multimodal model.\\nGPT-4o was originally introduced last year as a flagship model that reasoned across audio, vision, and text in real time. I understand that OpenAI will launch GPT-4.1 alongside smaller GPT-4.1 mini and nano versions as soon as next week.\\nOpenAI is also readying the full version of its o3 reasoning model and an o4 mini version that could debut even sooner. AI engineer Tibor Blaho discovered references to o4 mini, o4 mini high, and o3 in a new ChatGPT web version earlier today, suggesting these additions are imminent. I understand o3 and o4 mini are both set to debut next week, unless OpenAI moves the launch plans around.\\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman teased on X that OpenAI would be launching an exciting feature today, but it’s not clear if this is related to the o3 and o4 mini references in ChatGPT or not. Sources caution that OpenAI has delayed the introduction of some new models recently due to capacity issues, so it’s possible for the new GPT-4.1 model introduction to slip beyond a planned debut next week. I asked OpenAI to comment on this story, but the company didn’t respond in time for publication.\\nAltman revealed on X earlier this month that customers “should expect new releases from OpenAI to be delayed, stuff to break, and for service to sometimes be slow as we deal with capacity challenges.” OpenAI’s more advanced image generation capabilities forced the company to temporarily rate limit requests last month, and Altman claimed “our GPUs are melting” due to the popularity of the built-in image generator for users of ChatGPT’s free tier.\\nMost Popular\\nInstaller\\nA weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.\\nThis is the title for the native ad\\nMore in AI\\nThis is the title for the native ad\\nTop Stories\\n© 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

       "   'raw_content': 'Site Navigation\\nSections\\nThe Print Edition\\nA Love-Hate Letter to Technology\\nVauhini Vara’s new memoir critiques the web in a novel way, turning its products into a kind of poetry.\\nA few years ago, I reached the tabs limit on my iPhone’s web browser; apparently, you can keep only up to 500 windows open in Safari. Rather than close them all, I scrolled back—and stumbled upon an abridged atlas of my life, dating from high school. There was the first recipe I cooked for my parents, a gift for a crush, tickets for my younger sister’s first live concert. I was initially enchanted by this record of buried memories; then I was alarmed by the dossiers the tabs represented: sellable data about my digital preferences and habits that have likely been collected by Apple, Amazon, Google, and the like.\\nFor many people born in recent decades, the internet feels inseparable from its corporate operators—as well as from our lives. Catalogs of data like mine abound in Netflix viewing histories, prehistoric Facebook posts, and, now, dialogues with ChatGPT—imprints of the way the web informs and commoditizes work and friendship, sorrow and joy. These digital archives, and the strange intimacy that produces them, are the subject of Searches, a new essay collection by the novelist and journalist Vauhini Vara. “The material that Google valued for its financial potential was, for me, valuable on its own terms,” Vara writes in her opening essay, after downloading a decade of her search history. “It taught me about the person I’d been during each day of my existence, about how I’d changed from one day to the next.” What follows is a striking record of past searches, organized as a list of prompts: “What should I do with my life. What is a deductible. What happens to syrian refugees who return.”\\nIn a growing lineage of books critiquing the power that tech titans wield over our physical world, Searches stands out for emphasizing how they’ve also shaped our private psychological terrain. Vara treats her own life as a vehicle to recount the disquieting history of the internet—or perhaps the other way around. For instance, an essay on social media is interwoven with Vara’s coming of age in AOL chat rooms, attending Stanford when TheFacebook hits campus, and becoming The Wall Street Journal’s first Facebook reporter. Her decision to turn down the Apple beat at the Journal in 2007, the year the iPhone was released, in order to pursue an M.F.A. in fiction propels an exploration of how much human creativity depends on the ideas and labor of others. Drawing on her own reporting, as well as that of established tech critics including Shoshana Zuboff and Safiya Noble, Vara details Silicon Valley’s grip on the global economy, elections, and information ecosystems. This seamless blend of personal narrative and systemic critique parallels Vara’s subject: technology that has made it feel impossible to compose a self and a society without it.\\nVara, like many of her readers, is both enchanted by the web and disgusted with the companies that control it. Firms that have allegedly spread misinformation, flouted intellectual-property rights, and exploited workers—to name only a few of Vara’s grievances—also provide software that frequently benefits people’s lives. Navigating streets, making everyday purchases, and staying in touch with friends without the tech giants is “hard for a lot of us to imagine,” Vara writes. “Let me not speak for you,” she adds. “I continue to use these products. I continue to use these products because I feel I benefit from them.” These companies feel like necessary building blocks of modern existence. That doesn’t mean we have to like them.\\nAmazon has transformed the geography of wealth and power\\nVara’s essays pulse with anger but also disappointment, as she laments the digital worlds that could have been. “Before the content existed,” she writes, “there were people like me who, through the act of searching, communicated a desire for answers.” From her searching emerges a book that might be called biography, historiography, cultural criticism, manifesto, or all of the above—a memoir, in a sense, of the internet.\\nWhat sets Searches apart from other techno-skeptical works is not its argument so much as its method. Each prose essay is part of a diptych, paired with a sort of found poem spun from the threads of Vara’s own digital web. These addenda include a history of Google searches, a diary of Amazon purchases and reviews, and an alphabetized list of Vara’s Twitter “interests” used for targeted advertising. As the book progresses, such pairings evolve into seeming collaborations: a satire about Silicon Valley accompanied by AI-generated illustrations, an essay about losing her sister to cancer that was co-written with GPT-3 (a precursor to ChatGPT). These formal experiments reveal the depths and limitations of these corporations’ knowledge, reworking text generated by major tech firms toward new ends—or, as it may be, beginnings.\\nSam Altman, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai, and other tech barons like to prophesy a future in which AI cures cancer and makes everyone prosperous. Although such statements present this glorious end point as inevitable, the evidence that generative AI can bring about such grand benefits, or that they would be fairly distributed, is scant; better established are the tremendous costs—financial, labor, environmental—on top of clear technological limitations. The messianic claims of AI’s biggest stakeholders are tautologies: Generative AI will transform civilization; therefore, we must be empowered to steer it in the right direction. The proof that generative AI will be revolutionary? That so many people have empowered us to steer the revolution.\\nVara presents the AI boom as the apotheosis of Silicon Valley’s greed, the beginning of “a dramatic leap in the corporate capture of human existence.” As if to justify her distrust, executives who once championed democracy and public good—Pinchai, Altman, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk—have ingratiated themselves to a president who seems to be tearing American democracy apart for corporate benefit. In 2017, Vara notes, Altman wanted “to figure out how Big Tech might be part of the anti-Trump resistance”; in January, the OpenAI CEO wrote that Donald Trump “will be incredible for the country in many ways!”\\nWas Sam Altman right about the job market?\\nIf an AI-saturated future is a self-fulfilling prophecy, then everyday people can also “make reality-bending declarations about the future,” Vara writes; recent boycotts against Google, Amazon, and Meta suggest the immediacy of her project. She runs through a number of writers, scholars, and projects attempting to reorganize the internet: Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan’s antitrust investigations; regulatory proposals from Senator Elizabeth Warren; the nonprofit foundations running Wikipedia, Firefox, and Signal.\\nBut Searches is not intended to devise new policy. Rather, Vara’s found poems work on a personal and emotional level, attempting to reorder readers’ individual and collective relationships to digital technology. Consider, for instance, her recomposed Google search history. “When to switch from car seat to booster seat. When to switch to twin bed. When do children learn to read percentages,” reads one stretch, tracking Vara’s motherhood in a way that leaves her pride or anxiety implicit. “Why did google buy nest. Why is property crime so high in san francisco. Why don’t my friends have kids,” reads another, associating Google’s purchase of the smart-home start-up with surveillance and the domestic sphere. Still another composition features a Google Translate interpretation of an essay Vara wrote in Spanish, which contains both mistranslations and stretches where the software turned flawed Spanish into grammatical English. Each of these ready-made verses reveals the product’s bugs and gaps—Google and Amazon histories can’t capture an infant’s laugh, and a translation app fails to evoke a tongue tripping over new sounds. Rather than merely illustrating corporate omnipotence, Vara exposes the fragility of the technology itself: a nonhuman force that still depends on humanity—and is unable to encompass it.\\nThe centerpiece of Vara’s experiments is “Ghosts,” the essay about her sister, which was widely acclaimed when it was first published in The Believer in 2021. Across nine iterations, Vara writes more and more of the essay, with GPT-3 completing each version. Vara worried, as she notes in Searches, that the essay’s success aggrandized a technology “that had been found to reinscribe harmful rhetoric, while exploiting human labor and natural resources.” But at the same time, uniformly rejecting the chatbot would be too simple, she adds, because “in my opinion, GPT-3 had produced the best lines in ‘Ghosts.’” Still, those lines referenced events that never occurred—which is precisely what prompted her to write, in each version, more and more of the essay; the AI “compelled me to assert my own consciousness by writing against the falsehoods.” GPT-3’s weaknesses brought out her strengths. For republication in Searches, Vara reclaims the final words from the bot: Her sister taught her “to lie believably. But, then, to tell the truth, too.”\\nThe diptychs in Searches echo the work of a number of contemporary poets, such as Solmaz Sharif, Robin Coste Lewis, and Nicole Sealey, who have taken the language of authorities—a Pentagon dictionary of terms, the museum titles of artworks, a government investigation into police violence—and reordered, redacted, and recontextualized the text to instantiate new meanings and realities. Vara’s essays, taken together, do something similar, feeling around for a future that cleaves digital technology from capitalism. “Is it even possible to subvert the tools of technological capitalism to create art from the raw material of my life?” she asks. “Is it possible to use them to cast light on the exploitation they facilitate and our complicity in it? Or are these exercises inherently corrupted by their reliance on the tools?” Yes, yes, and yes.\\n\\u200bWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

The two may not be in alignment.\\nEvidence showed attackers were going after access\\nHaving a website that is unconnected from your business means that you can use it as a honeypot to keep a gauge of what attackers are going after and what they might be getting up to within a network.\\nDepending on your business and security teams, they may even want to run a honeypot that is designed to trick and trap attackers trying to get into your business. Review the log files on these types of web servers, and you will soon see that attackers are going after the very thing that my cyber insurance carriers were also interested in: my remote access.\\nThe attackers were looking for vulnerable VPN entrances to a web server by attempting to log into a Cisco VPN appliance. Upon examining the web server logs, we found approximately 320,000 requests to a non-existent page looking specifically for the webpage of domain.com/+CSCOE+/logon.html.\\nFor those of you unfamiliar with the CSCOE alias, it’s a CISCO hardware appliance that can be deployed in either a dedicated firewall or IPS mode. In this case, it’s a web service for a VPN that users can go to https://<hostname>/+CSCOE+/logon.html#form_title_text and log in to get the client.\\nIn October of 2024, CISCO announced a vulnerability in the Remote Access VPN feature of the Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. There are no workarounds or mitigations, only patches that need to be installed.\\nDuring the annual renewal of cyber insurance, the insurance carrier would not even consider insuring my business if we did not demonstrate that we had some fundamental protections in place. Based on the questions and bullet points, you could tell they saw the remote access, third-party vendor access, and network administrator accounts as weak points that needed additional protection.\\nMFA is a requirement most insurers insist upon\\nFor example, they mandated that all remote access, including VPN access and all remote monitoring and management (RMM) solutions, such as remote desktop protocol (RDP), be protected by multifactor authentication (MFA), mandating that it should also be enforced on email access and any remote access to critical resources, including third-party and vendor access.\\nThey also required that I implement MFA authentication protection on all network administrator accounts and any other user accounts with elevated permissions within your network.\\nThey wanted me to enable an endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution on all endpoints so that all detected endpoint activity is monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days of the year.\\nIs MFA and EDR enough? How about password managers and zero trust?\\nHowever, I think they missed some things when it comes to remote access and multifactor mandates. For example, one that I think should be a mandate is a password manager program that enforces longer passwords and passphrases.\\nBut I wouldn’t stop with merely mandating a password manager program. For anyone who has network administrator rights, there should be an additional biometric or similar process that protects not only the administrator login of the password manager software but all cloud portals that control Azure, Google, or Amazon Web services — key cloud services.\\nNor did the insurers mention best practices such as zero-trust network access or other processes that network administrators should be using when they remote in to a network or administer a network.\\nWhile training on phishing attacks was also recommended, broader training regarding the use of remote access and the sensitivity of sending data through the internet was not discussed. I was also surprised to see no mention of the use of artificial Intelligence and no questions about any policies I might have regarding the use of such techniques.\\nMany risks aren’t required to be addressed by insurers\\nOften these cyber insurance policies recommend that there are enterprise policies and processes in place to ensure that operating system updates are installed in a timely manner following recommendations from industry agencies such as CISA and others, but they don’t address other sources of patching risks in a firm.\\nFor example, I found no mention of having processes of controlling patching for appliances, internet of things devices or other hardware that might need software updates or bios updates in order to maintain a secure posture.\\nMultifactor authentication isn’t without it’s own risks and vulnerabilities. Attackers are using techniques such as phishing, vishing, and smishing to trick users into divulging their MFA codes.\\nPhishing uses social engineering to trick victims into paying money, handing over sensitive information, or downloading malware. Smishing (SMS phishing) involves sending malicious text messages and tricking the user into approving an authentication prompt. Through vishing (voice phishing), scammers impersonate professionals such as help desk technicians over the phone to trick them into revealing sensitive data or transferring money.\\nThe risks of endpoint compromise should never be overlooked as attackers can enter a system with malware and steal session cookies or create shadow sessions. In addition, you could accidentally lock someone out if connectivity is impacted or the user loses access to an MFA device, such as a cellphone or a hardware token. Training users on how to properly use MFA, as well as planning ahead for those times when you have problems using MFA, should be part of any firm’s long-term security planning process.\\nRelated content\\nIs HR running your employee security training?

For the third month running, Google has confirmed the bad news that Android phones are under attack, as another routine monthly security release turns into an emergency update now warning. There is one critical difference this time though, with major implications for both Pixel and Samsung.\\n“There are indications,” Google warns, that CVE-2024-53150 and CVE-2024-53197 “may be under limited, targeted exploitation.” The first is a memory vulnerability within Android’s kernel, leaving a device exposed to local data exfiltration. If that brings forensic exploits to mind, then the second vulnerability hammers it home. This is another of the flaws known to have been exploited by Cellebrite in Europe.\\nWhile Android zero-days may now be the norm, what isn’t the norm is Samsung matching Pixel’s pace in rushing out these updates. Last month, the Galaxy-maker missed one of Android’s exploited fixes yet again. But CVE-2024-50302 from March is included in Samsung’s April update, a month behind Pixel. Much more notably, both of Android’s April fixes are also included in Samsung’s April release. That’s a big deal.\\nAccording to Android hardener GrapheneOS, these “2 more vulnerabilities marked as being exploited in the wild [are]\\nWith perfect timing, the need to ensure Android (and iPhone) phones are always updated when new security fixes are released has also been reinforced by a raft of government intel agencies. “In new advisories,” the cyber wing of the U.K. spy agency warned “the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) – a part of GCHQ – and agencies in Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand and the United States have revealed details about how malicious cyber actors are using two forms of spyware to target individuals.”\\nThe latest attacks have been attributed to Chinese state affiliated actors, targeting “Uyghur, Tibetan and Taiwanese communities as well as civil society groups… The malicious software – dubbed MOONSHINE and BADBAZAAR – hide malicious functions inside otherwise legitimate apps in a technique known as ‘trojanising’.\"\\nThese trojans hijack a device, accessing microphones, cameras, on device data including messaging and photos, as well as deploying real-time tracking. These kinds of vulnerabilities are being exploited by forensic firms, cybercriminals and state actors. There’s a constant game of cat and mouse with Google, Samsung and other OEMs — as well as Apple — to stay ahead, or rather not too far behind.\\nBut Samsung has been falling behind in security updates just as the Android world obsesses about its delays on Android OS upgrades as well. With notable timing, these security updates turned up the same day Samsung finally started to roll out its stable One UI 7 / Android 15 upgrade to its 2024 and 2023 flagships.\\nYet again this month we have seen forensic exploits patched by one of Android or iPhone, with both global operating systems clearly vulnerable to the deep pockets of an industry primed to break device security. Samsung’s One UI 7 incudes new protections against these forensic exploits and Android 16 looks like it will match iPhone’s non-activity reboot, making such exploits harder. Interesting times indeed.\\nAs expected, the April update is now hitting Pixel devices. Per 9to5Google, “the Android 15 April security patch is rolling out today for the Pixel 6, 6 Pro, 6a, 7, 7 Pro, 7a, Tablet, Fold, 8, 8 Pro, 8a, 9, 9 Pro, 9 Pro XL, 9 Pro Fold, and 9a.”\\nWhile Android Central points out that “April security patch has started rolling out to the entire Pixel lineup, including the latest Pixel 9a, solving a few camera issues for several Pixel series while also solving the brightness drop problem some users faced in March. The security update arrives just as Pixel 9a hits the market for all to purchase.”\\nGoogle confirms that “all supported Pixel devices running Android 15 will receive these software updates starting April 10, and the rollout will continue over the next week in phases, depending on carrier and device. You will receive a notification once the system update is available for your device.”\\nUsers can check they’re running the latest Android software complete with the new fixes by checking their version number. “Open your device’s Settings app. Tap About phone or About tablet Android version. Find your Android version, Android security update, and Build number.”\\nGlobal\\nTaiwan+EMEA\\nVerizon\\nDeutsche Telekom'}, {'title': 'Defending Healthcare from the Growing Email Threat Landscape in 2025 - HIT Consultant', 'image_url': 'https://cdn.gttkorea.com/news/photo/202212/3550_3715_390.jpg', 'raw_content': 'Defending Healthcare from the Growing Email Threat Landscape in 2025\\nby Usman Choudhary, General Manager, VIPRE Security Group 04/11/2025 Leave a Comment\\nHealthcare organizations remain prime targets for cybercriminals, with email-based attacks evolving in complexity and scale. As cybercriminals become more sophisticated, leveraging artificial intelligence and advanced deception tactics, health systems, insurers, and their vendors must beat back these threats to safeguard patient data, ensure data security compliance, and maintain operational integrity.\\nPerhaps the most alarming trend we face now, in healthcare and other vital sectors, is the persistence of business email compromise (BEC) as a dominant attack vector. Cybercriminals have refined their impersonation techniques, with 88% of these attacks relying on executive and CEO spoofing to trick employees into transferring funds or revealing sensitive data. Since healthcare organizations frequently deal with confidential patient information, financial transactions, and regulatory compliance, these attacks pose a significant risk to the industry.\\nFraudulent emails, appearing as legitimate requests from high-ranking executives, exploit the trust of healthcare staff, leading to substantial financial losses and data breaches.\\nAdditionally, the use of artificial intelligence in phishing attacks has surged. Cybercriminals are now deploying AI-generated phishing schemes that leverage synthetic media, including images, voice recordings, and video deep fakes, to manipulate employees into revealing login credentials or granting unauthorized access.\\nThe ability of AI to convincingly replicate the voices and appearances of trusted figures makes these scams harder to detect, increasing the likelihood of successful breaches. As AI technology advances, healthcare organizations must adopt sophisticated email security solutions to counter these emerging threats.\\nInfostealers advancing threats against health systems\\nThe rise of infostealers further exacerbates the threat landscape. Malicious software such as Stealc and AgentTesla is increasingly used to infiltrate healthcare networks and extract patient records, financial data, and other sensitive information. These stealthy malware programs operate undetected, harvesting data from infected systems and transmitting it back to attackers.\\nWith the growing reliance on digital patient records and cloud-based healthcare solutions, the stakes for securing information have never been higher.\\nAnother emerging concern is the increasing prevalence of QR code-based phishing attacks. A recent spike in QR code-related phishing attempts signals that cybercriminals are adapting their strategies to bypass traditional security filters. Healthcare employees, who often scan QR codes to access patient information, vendor portals, or regulatory documentation, may unknowingly fall victim to these deceptive tactics. Attackers embed malicious URLs within QR codes, redirecting unsuspecting users to fraudulent websites designed to capture login credentials and deploy malware.\\nHealthcare’s vast network of providers, insurers, and third-party vendors makes it a lucrative target for email-based fraud and ransomware infections. The industry’s interconnected nature increases the potential for widespread breaches, compounding the impact of a single compromised email account.\\nCybercriminals exploit this complexity, targeting weak points within the supply chain to gain entry into broader healthcare networks. To combat these evolving threats, healthcare organizations must prioritize a multi-layered approach to email security. Implementing advanced email security solutions capable of detecting AI-generated threats, deepfake content, and sophisticated phishing attempts is crucial.\\nAdditionally, continuous employee cybersecurity training is essential in building a culture of awareness and vigilance. Staff must be educated on recognizing fraudulent emails, verifying the authenticity of executive requests, and exercising caution when scanning QR codes or clicking on links from unknown sources.\\nAs email security threats become more automated and difficult to detect, proactive defense strategies will be the key to protecting healthcare organizations in 2025. By leveraging advanced threat detection technologies and fostering a strong cybersecurity culture, healthcare leaders can mitigate risks and ensure the safety of patient data and critical business operations.\\nThe evolving email threat landscape underscores the urgency for health systems to stay ahead of cybercriminals and implement robust security measures to navigate the challenges of the digital age.\\nAbout Usman Choudhary\\nAs the general manager for VIPRE Security Group, Usman Choudhary is responsible for executing the company’s product vision and strategy for advanced threat defense solutions. With contributions to several patented innovations in the early stages of the security space, he was instrumental in influencing the evolution of mission-critical cyber defense programs for the U.S. Navy (PROMETHEUS) and other government agencies, as well as security programs at Microsoft and other large enterprises.\\nTap Native\\nGet in-depth healthcare technology analysis and commentary delivered straight to your email weekly\\nReader Interactions\\nPrimary Sidebar\\nSubscribe to HIT Consultant\\nLatest insightful articles delivered straight to your inbox weekly.\\nSubmit a Tip or Pitch\\nFeatured Insights\\n2025 EMR Software Pricing Guide\\nFeatured Interview\\nHealthcare M&A Slowdown 2024: Alvarez & Marsal’s Raheel Khan on Market Challenges & 2025 Outlook\\nMost-Read\\nVirta Health Cuts GLP-1 Use for Weight Loss Over 50%, Driving Cost Savings for Payers\\nRock Health: U.S. Digital Health Funding Reaches $3B in Q1 2025\\nAI Ambient Scribes Show Promise in Reducing Clinician Burnout, Research Reveals\\nHow 3D Modeling is Transforming Medical Imaging and Diagnosis\\n23andMe Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy to Facilitate Sale\\nVA’s EHR Modernization Faces Turbulence Amid Contract Cancellations and Deployment Acceleration\\n1 in 7 Americans Now Live in a Pharmacy Desert, GoodRx Reveals\\nAledade Expands Humana Value-Based Care Agreement to Serve FQHCs\\nDigital Health Adoption Trends by Each Generation: From Gen Z to Boomers\\nDigital Musculoskeletal Care Hinge Health Files for IPO\\nSecondary Sidebar\\nFooter\\nCompany\\nEditorial Coverage\\nConnect\\nSubscribe to HIT Consultant Media\\nLatest insightful articles delivered straight to your inbox weekly\\nCopyright ©\\xa02025.

April’s reading was lower than anything seen during the Great Recession.\\nPresident Donald Trump’s volatile trade war, which threatens higher inflation, has significantly weighed on Americans’ moods these past few months. That malaise worsened leading up to Trump’s announcement last week of sweeping tariffs, according to the survey.\\nAd Feedback\\nAd Feedback\\n“This decline was, like the last month’s, pervasive and unanimous across age, income, education, geographic region and political affiliation,” Joanne Hsu, the survey’s director, said in a release.\\n“Sentiment has now lost more than 30% since December 2024 amid growing worries about trade war developments that have oscillated over the course of the year,” she added.\\nThe Federal Reserve and Wall Street are watching closely how souring sentiment translates into consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of the US economy, and whether Americans lose faith that inflation will return to normal in the coming years.\\nTrump on Wednesday paused his massive tariff hike on dozens of countries for 90 days, but kept in place a 10% baseline duty for all imports into the US and separate tariffs on specific products and commodities. The so-called reciprocal tariffs, albeit short lived, were the sharpest increase in US duties ever on data going back 200 years, Fitch Ratings told CNN\\nChina, however, wasn’t included in Trump’s tariff reprieve, continuing a contentious tit-for-tat between the world’s two largest economies that stretched into Friday, with Beijing jacking up its retaliatory tariffs on US imports to 125% from 84%.\\nThe Michigan survey was fielded between March 25 and April 8, so it doesn’t capture respondents’ reaction to the recently announced tariff delay.\\nThe relationship between sentiment and spending\\nIn economics, surveys are referred to as “soft data” and measures capturing actual economic activity, such as retail sales, are known as “hard data.”\\nThe soft data has clearly deteriorated because of Trump’s tariffs: The latest Michigan survey showed that “the share of consumers expecting unemployment to rise in the year ahead increased for the fifth consecutive month and is now more than double the November 2024 reading and the highest since 2009,” according to a release.\\nStiff tariffs won’t usher in the economic success President Donald Trump is seeking, according to most economists, but cementing America's dominance in artificial intelligence could. Photo Illustration by Jason Lancaster/CNN/Getty Images Related article Trump is trying to reinvent 1950 with his tariffs. He should be planning for 2050\\nYet, the hard data still looks decent. Employers continue to hire at a brisk pace and shoppers haven’t convincingly reined in their spending just yet, though retail sales have come in weaker than expected recently.\\n“Sometimes the surveys are very negative, but they keep spending,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week at an event near Washington, DC. “People spent right through the pandemic and they spent right through this time of higher inflation.”\\nSpending by better-off Americans has played a key role in keeping the US economy humming along these past few years, but the recent turbulence on Wall Street, triggered by Trump’s tariffs, is putting that under threat.\\n“Wealthy consumers’ stock market gains kept the economy growing in 2024 despite high prices, but the wealthy won’t feel confident enough to keep spending if this keeps up,” Bill Adams, chief economist at Comerica Bank, wrote in a recent analyst note.\\nA growing worry for the Fed\\nWhat do you think? Join 11 others in the comments\\nView Comments\\nThere’s one survey-based measure that matters a whole lot for the Fed: Americans’ perception of prices. It’s critical because they can be self-fulfilling — if people expect inflation to climb and remain elevated in the long run, they adjust their spending accordingly.\\nSo far, that measure has been trending in the wrong direction: Expectations for inflation rates in the year ahead surged to 6.7% this month from 5% in March, the highest level since 1981, while expectations for the next five to 10 years climbed to 4.4% from 4.1%.\\nIf people do lose faith that inflation will ever get back to normal in the coming years, that would make it extremely difficult for the Fed’s monetary policy to fight inflation.\\n“History teaches that when higher inflation expectations become entrenched, the road back to price stability is longer, the labor market is weaker and the economic scars are deeper,” Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said Thursday at an event in Dallas.\\nInflation expectations these days may be more susceptible than usual to becoming “un-anchored,” since consumers just experienced a period of high inflation, leaving many Americans particularly sensitive to elevated prices.\\n11 comments\\nUp next\\nAnother inflation report underlines the strength of the US economy before Trump’s tariff chaos Apr 11, 2025 3 minute readmin read\\nTrump’s massive tariffs shake markets, spark recession fears Apr 3, 2025 6 minute readmin read\\nUS inflation cooled to a six-month low in March, but tariff pressures are quickly mounting Apr 10, 2025 5 minute readmin read\\nWall Street is fed up with Trump’s tariffs.

The two reportedly battled over who would spearhead Siri\\'s new capabilities, with both ultimately receiving pieces of the project.\\nApple Intelligence faced significant delays after internal testing revealed Siri was inaccurate on nearly a third of requests. Apple subsequently admitted that it would take longer than expected to roll out the more personalized \\u200cSiri\\u200c experience, and that these features will be rolled out \"in the coming year.\"\\nHowever, according to the report, Apple still plans to release its enhanced Siri experience this fall. The functionality includes personal context, onscreen awareness, and improved app integration. Some Apple executives reportedly aren\\'t concerned about the delay, and believe competitors haven\\'t perfected AI either, giving Apple time to get it right.\\nFollowing the delay, software chief Craig Federighi reorganized executives, removing responsibility for the new Siri from Giannandrea and reassigning it to Mike Rockwell, who leads the Vision Pro division. The details of Apple\\'s Siri team changes and the delayed Siri revamp were previously reported by Bloomberg and The Information.\\nFor more details on Apple\\'s internal issues, including political infighting, budget constraints, and talent drain, see The New York Times\\' full report.\\nGet weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.\\nPopular Stories\\niOS 19 Leak Reveals Alleged New Design With Rounder App Icons, Floating Tab Bar, and More\\nReport Reveals Internal Chaos Behind Apple\\'s Siri Failure\\nWaiting for the Perfect MacBook Pro? 2026 Might Be the Year\\niPhone 17 Pro\\'s New Rear Camera Bar \\'Same Color As Rest of Device\\'\\n5 Biggest Changes Rumored for iPhone 17 Pro\\nTrump Believes Apple Could Manufacture iPhones in the U.S.\\nApple Store in Chicago Area Permanently Closing Later This Month\\niOS 18.4.1 Update Coming Soon for iPhones\\nAll the Design Changes Rumored for iOS 19 So Far\\nTop Rated Comments\\nNext Article\\nGuides\\nPriority Notifications, visual intelligence for iPhone 15 Pro, new emoji, and more.\\nApple Intelligence is what Apple is calling its artificial intelligence feature set.

At the ongoing TED Conference in Vancouver (via Axios), Shahram Izadi, who leads AR and VR initiatives at Google, took the stage wearing what looked like an ordinary pair of glasses. But these weren’t just any glasses. They were working prototypes of Google’s Android XR smart glasses.\\nAndroid XR glasses are shaping up to be one of the most exciting advancements in the Extended Reality space. They ditch the bulky headsets for a sleeker, more comfortable design, and could make XR tech more accessible and affordable. Powered by Gemini, Google’s AI, the glasses aim to become a whole new interface: think launching apps, using Circle to Search in real time, playing games, handling data, navigating with Google Maps projected into your line of sight, and more. We also recently discovered that Android Auto may be preparing support for smart glasses.\\nIt’s still unclear whether Google will release these glasses under its own brand, but we know for sure that they’re deep into development. Several publications have already gone hands-on with early prototypes, which included various styles, from classic eyeglasses to sunglasses. Prescription lenses are also part of the plan.\\nDuring the TED demo, Izadi and a colleague reportedly showed off some cases for the Android XR glasses, including live translations from Farsi to English powered by Gemini, scanning the contents of a book, and a memory feature that let the AI recall what the camera saw in the recent past. Izadi also claimed that the glasses were displaying his speech notes to him.\\nThese prototypes feature a built-in camera, in-lens display, mic, and speakers. A connected smartphone does all the heavy lifting, keeping the glasses lightweight.\\n“These glasses work with your phone, streaming back and forth, allowing the glasses to be very lightweight and access all of your phone apps,” Izadi explained.\\nThe demo of the glasses then went on to show how the platform would let users open connected Google apps like YouTube Music, Google Maps, and more.\\nAs we said before, we’re not sure if we’ll ever see Google’s own smart glasses on the market, but thanks to Samsung, we could get a pair of Android XR glasses very soon. According to a recent report, Samsung is planning a dual launch for its Project Moohan headset and a pair of smart glasses codenamed “Haean.” The Haean smart glasses are expected to prioritize comfort by fitting various face shapes and include multiple cameras and sensors to track movement.\"}, {'title': 'AU Deals: Only 48 Rupees for Tears of the Kingdom, A Half Price Monster Hunter Wilds, and More! - IGN', 'image_url': 'https://smartphonemagazine.nl/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/compressed_img-t0uDQHG8I7BAbQjYcsKKd7Fn.png', 'raw_content': \"Site Themes\\nChange Region\\nMore\\nNews\\nReviews\\nDiscover\\nVideos\\nAccount\\n20Q #XX: undefined\\nAU Deals: Only 48 Rupees for Tears of the Kingdom, A Half Price Monster Hunter Wilds, and More!\\nGlide into a great deal.\\nThank your own personaly deity—possibly Jin Dahaad—it's Friday.

For the third month running, Google has confirmed the bad news that Android phones are under attack, as another routine monthly security release turns into an emergency update now warning. There is one critical difference this time though, with major implications for both Pixel and Samsung.\\n“There are indications,” Google warns, that CVE-2024-53150 and CVE-2024-53197 “may be under limited, targeted exploitation.” The first is a memory vulnerability within Android’s kernel, leaving a device exposed to local data exfiltration. If that brings forensic exploits to mind, then the second vulnerability hammers it home. This is another of the flaws known to have been exploited by Cellebrite in Europe.\\nWhile Android zero-days may now be the norm, what isn’t the norm is Samsung matching Pixel’s pace in rushing out these updates. Last month, the Galaxy-maker missed one of Android’s exploited fixes yet again. But CVE-2024-50302 from March is included in Samsung’s April update, a month behind Pixel. Much more notably, both of Android’s April fixes are also included in Samsung’s April release. That’s a big deal.\\nAccording to Android hardener GrapheneOS, these “2 more vulnerabilities marked as being exploited in the wild [are]\\nWith perfect timing, the need to ensure Android (and iPhone) phones are always updated when new security fixes are released has also been reinforced by a raft of government intel agencies. “In new advisories,” the cyber wing of the U.K. spy agency warned “the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) – a part of GCHQ – and agencies in Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand and the United States have revealed details about how malicious cyber actors are using two forms of spyware to target individuals.”\\nThe latest attacks have been attributed to Chinese state affiliated actors, targeting “Uyghur, Tibetan and Taiwanese communities as well as civil society groups… The malicious software – dubbed MOONSHINE and BADBAZAAR – hide malicious functions inside otherwise legitimate apps in a technique known as ‘trojanising’.\"\\nThese trojans hijack a device, accessing microphones, cameras, on device data including messaging and photos, as well as deploying real-time tracking. These kinds of vulnerabilities are being exploited by forensic firms, cybercriminals and state actors. There’s a constant game of cat and mouse with Google, Samsung and other OEMs — as well as Apple — to stay ahead, or rather not too far behind.\\nBut Samsung has been falling behind in security updates just as the Android world obsesses about its delays on Android OS upgrades as well. With notable timing, these security updates turned up the same day Samsung finally started to roll out its stable One UI 7 / Android 15 upgrade to its 2024 and 2023 flagships.\\nYet again this month we have seen forensic exploits patched by one of Android or iPhone, with both global operating systems clearly vulnerable to the deep pockets of an industry primed to break device security. Samsung’s One UI 7 incudes new protections against these forensic exploits and Android 16 looks like it will match iPhone’s non-activity reboot, making such exploits harder. Interesting times indeed.\\nAs expected, the April update is now hitting Pixel devices. Per 9to5Google, “the Android 15 April security patch is rolling out today for the Pixel 6, 6 Pro, 6a, 7, 7 Pro, 7a, Tablet, Fold, 8, 8 Pro, 8a, 9, 9 Pro, 9 Pro XL, 9 Pro Fold, and 9a.”\\nWhile Android Central points out that “April security patch has started rolling out to the entire Pixel lineup, including the latest Pixel 9a, solving a few camera issues for several Pixel series while also solving the brightness drop problem some users faced in March. The security update arrives just as Pixel 9a hits the market for all to purchase.”\\nGoogle confirms that “all supported Pixel devices running Android 15 will receive these software updates starting April 10, and the rollout will continue over the next week in phases, depending on carrier and device. You will receive a notification once the system update is available for your device.”\\nUsers can check they’re running the latest Android software complete with the new fixes by checking their version number. “Open your device’s Settings app. Tap About phone or About tablet Android version. Find your Android version, Android security update, and Build number.”\\nGlobal\\nTaiwan+EMEA\\nVerizon\\nDeutsche Telekom'}, {'title': '15 Best Electronic Music Songs of All Time - Singersroom.com', 'image_url': 'http://menu.mtn.co.kr/upload/article/2014/03/25/2014032516570595440_00_406.jpg', 'raw_content': 'Published Time: 2025-04-11T05:06:11-04:00\\n15 Best Electronic Music Songs of All Time - Singersroom.com\\nHome\\nAdvertise your Music\\nContact\\nFriday, April 11, 2025\\nSINGERSROOM\\nR&B Music\\nR&B Artists\\nR&B Videos\\nSong Guides\\nMusic Lessons\\nBest Guitar Lessons Near Me\\nBest Singing Lessons Near Me\\nGospel\\nFeatured\\nSocial\\nFacebook\\nInstagram\\nTwitter\\nLive R&B Radio\\nSubmit Music\\nContact\\nR&B Music\\nR&B Artists\\nR&B Videos\\nSong Guides\\nMusic Lessons\\nBest Guitar Lessons Near Me\\nBest Singing Lessons Near Me\\nGospel\\nFeatured\\nSocial\\nFacebook\\nInstagram\\nTwitter\\nLive R&B Radio\\nSubmit Music\\nContact\\nNo Result\\nView All Result\\nSINGERSROOM\\nNo Result\\nView All Result\\nHome Best Songs Guide\\n15 Best Electronic Music Songs of All Time\\nList of the Top 15 Best Electronic Music Songs of All Time\\nby Samuel Moore\\nApril 11, 2025\\nin Best Songs Guide\\n0\\n117\\nSHARES\\nShare on FacebookShare on Twitter\\nElectronic music has electrified dance floors, redefined pop culture, and transformed the way we experience sound.

So turn up the volume, feel the bass, and get ready to experience the ultimate playlist of electronic legends. Let the countdown begin.\\nTable of Contents\\n1. “One More Time” – Daft Punk (2000)\\n2. “Sandstorm” – Darude (1999)\\n3. “Strobe” – deadmau5 (2009)\\n4. “Levels” – Avicii (2011)\\n5. “Animals” – Martin Garrix (2013)\\n6. “Titanium” – David Guetta ft.

The track marked a pivotal moment for electronic music, bringing house into the mainstream while staying true to Daft Punk’s robotic funk aesthetic. Built on a masterful loop and a subtle yet powerful use of auto-tune, it’s a song that feels both timeless and futuristic. “One More Time” isn’t just a dance track—it’s a cultural milestone, still pulsing through clubs and festivals more than two decades later.\\n2. “Sandstorm” – Darude (1999)\\nWhen Darude dropped “Sandstorm” in 1999, he didn’t just release a trance banger—he created a global phenomenon. With its relentless tempo and iconic synth riff, this Finnish export became an instant club hit and a defining track of the late ’90s electronic era. Its pounding energy made it a staple in sports arenas and internet culture alike, eventually achieving meme status without losing any of its original punch. “Sandstorm” is pure adrenaline in audio form, a track that has stood the test of time by continuously finding new generations of fans through its sheer, unrelenting momentum.\\n3. “Strobe” – deadmau5 (2009)\\n“Strobe” is not just a song—it’s an emotional journey. Released in 2009, this progressive house gem from deadmau5 showcases his ability to blend intricate melodies with atmospheric depth. The track opens with a slow, ambient buildup that gradually unfolds into a hypnotic rhythm, demonstrating a patience and sophistication rarely seen in electronic music at the time. Its nearly eleven-minute runtime feels earned, as each layer adds emotional weight and sonic texture. “Strobe” remains a fan favorite and a testament to deadmau5’s role as a pioneer of melodic, introspective EDM that moves both heart and feet.\\n4. “Levels” – Avicii (2011)\\nWhen “Levels” dropped in 2011, it immediately signaled a shift in the EDM landscape. Avicii, a young Swedish producer, crafted a track that was both anthemic and emotionally resonant. Built around a soaring Etta James sample, “Levels” married soulful vocals with a euphoric synth line that became instantly recognizable. The track’s sunny disposition and flawless production catapulted it into festival setlists worldwide and helped define the “big room” sound of the early 2010s. Tragically, Avicii’s life was cut short, but “Levels” remains a shining legacy of his genius—an electrifying reminder of how electronic music can uplift the soul.\\n5. “Animals” – Martin Garrix (2013)\\nMartin Garrix was just 17 when he unleashed “Animals” in 2013, but the track hit with the force of a seasoned veteran’s magnum opus. With its minimalist drop and primal energy, “Animals” revolutionized the festival circuit and kicked off the rise of big-room house. The absence of vocals made it stand out even more, proving that a clever hook and pounding rhythm could dominate charts and dance floors alike. It became a blueprint for aspiring producers and a staple for DJs everywhere. “Animals” didn’t just launch a career—it ignited a movement and left an indelible mark on modern EDM.\\n6. “Titanium” – David Guetta ft. Sia (2011)\\n“Titanium” is a powerful fusion of pop and electronic music, showcasing the collaborative brilliance of David Guetta and Sia. Released in 2011, the track pairs Sia’s emotionally charged vocals with a soaring synth-laden drop that’s both epic and empowering. The lyrics speak to resilience and inner strength, resonating with listeners far beyond the dance floor. Guetta’s polished production gave the track a cinematic quality, transforming it into a global anthem. “Titanium” was a defining moment for both artists, and it helped further blur the lines between mainstream pop and EDM at a time when the crossover was just beginning.\\n7. “Born Slippy .NUXX” – Underworld (1996)\\nUnderworld’s “Born Slippy .NUXX” is a visceral experience, a chaotic and hypnotic masterpiece that exploded into public consciousness with its inclusion in the 1996 film Trainspotting. Originally released as a B-side, the track’s pounding beat, stream-of-consciousness vocals, and emotional crescendo made it a cult classic. Karl Hyde’s cryptic lyrics, delivered in a slurred, almost drunken cadence, paired with the track’s relentless drive, created a sound that was as disorienting as it was exhilarating. It captured the wild energy of the ’90s rave scene and remains one of the most iconic and emotionally charged tracks in electronic music history.\\n8. “Blue (Da Ba Dee)” – Eiffel 65 (1998)\\nEiffel 65’s “Blue (Da Ba Dee)” is one of the most infectious earworms to ever come out of the Eurodance explosion of the late ’90s. Released in 1998, the song combined a catchy synth hook with heavily auto-tuned vocals that told the oddly melancholic tale of a man who sees the world in shades of blue. Despite—or perhaps because of—its unusual lyrics and robotic delivery, the track topped charts worldwide and became a cultural touchstone. “Blue” isn’t just a novelty—it’s a nostalgic ride through late-’90s dance pop, and its quirky charm continues to resonate with listeners decades later.\\n9. “Firestarter” – The Prodigy (1996)\\nWhen “Firestarter” erupted onto the scene in 1996, The Prodigy blew the doors off the electronic genre with a sound that was raw, aggressive, and unapologetically punk. Fronted by Keith Flint’s snarling vocals, the track melded breakbeats, distorted guitars, and industrial synths into a rebellious anthem that redefined what electronic music could be. It was confrontational and chaotic, yet expertly produced, and it became the UK’s first number-one single for The Prodigy. “Firestarter” didn’t just spark a fire—it detonated a bomb in the electronic landscape, introducing a generation to the darker, edgier side of rave culture.\\n10. “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger” – Daft Punk (2001)\\nDaft Punk’s “Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger,” released in 2001, is a masterclass in robotic funk and audio innovation. With its chopped-up vocals and glitchy, cyclical structure, the track embodies the duo’s futuristic vision. It’s both danceable and cerebral, driven by a repetitive mantra that somehow never grows old. The track gained a second life when Kanye West famously sampled it in “Stronger,” introducing it to a new generation. But even in its original form, “Harder, Better” is a shining example of how Daft Punk fused technology with soul, creating an enduring anthem that’s as clever as it is catchy.\\n11. “Get Lucky” – Daft Punk ft. Pharrell Williams (2013)\\n“Get Lucky” marked Daft Punk’s glorious return in 2013, and it was nothing short of a sensation. Featuring Pharrell Williams’ smooth vocals and Nile Rodgers’ legendary guitar work, the track was a sleek blend of disco, funk, and electronic polish. It shimmered with retro charm while feeling entirely fresh, capturing the essence of timeless groove. “Get Lucky” dominated the airwaves and swept awards, becoming one of the most successful and critically acclaimed songs of the decade. It was more than a comeback—it was a coronation, reaffirming Daft Punk’s place as electronic royalty with a song that made the whole world dance.\\n12. “Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites” – Skrillex (2010)\\nWith “Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites,” Skrillex didn’t just enter the scene—he exploded into it. Released in 2010, this track helped define the aggressive, bass-heavy sound of dubstep in the U.S. With its screeching drops, chopped vocal samples, and glitchy textures, it was a sonic assault that thrilled some and confused others—but no one could ignore it. The song’s iconic “Yes, oh my god!” vocal became a rallying cry for a new generation of ravers. Love it or hate it, “Scary Monsters” was groundbreaking, and it cemented Skrillex as a key figure in modern electronic music’s evolution.\\n13. “Insomnia” – Faithless (1995)\\n“Insomnia” by Faithless is a haunting epic that perfectly captures the tortured restlessness of sleepless nights. Released in 1995, the track opens with a slow, ominous build before erupting into an unforgettable synth riff that has since become one of the most iconic in dance music. Maxi Jazz’s spoken word verses carry a poetic weight, adding emotional depth to the pulsating beat. It’s a song that resonates on both physical and psychological levels, combining trance, trip-hop, and house elements into something truly unique. “Insomnia” remains a club classic and a deeply relatable anthem for night owls everywhere.\\n14. “I Remember” – deadmau5 & Kaskade (2008)\\n“I Remember” is a beautiful collaboration between deadmau5 and Kaskade, released in 2008, that captures the introspective side of electronic music. The track floats on a dreamy synthscape, with softly delivered vocals and a gentle, rolling rhythm that feels like a memory itself—faint, emotional, and fleeting. It’s not a festival banger but rather a sunrise anthem for reflective moments on the dance floor. With its subtle build and emotional resonance, “I Remember” helped define the progressive house scene of the late 2000s and showcased the genre’s potential for storytelling and mood rather than just energy.\\n15. “Around the World” – Daft Punk (1997)\\n“Around the World” is Daft Punk at their most playful and hypnotic. Released in 1997, this track is built entirely around a single phrase repeated over and over, yet it never becomes tiresome. Why? Because the production is a masterclass in variation and groove. Every loop, bassline, and robotic vocal tweak is carefully layered to keep the rhythm evolving. It’s funky, futuristic, and mesmerizing—like a circuit board learning to dance. The accompanying music video, directed by Michel Gondry, became iconic in its own right. “Around the World” is a shining example of minimalist genius in electronic music form.\\nSamuel Moore\\nSamuel Moore is a frequent contributor to Singers Room.

Denver did indeed inform its superstar Nikola Jokic that Malone, with whom Jokic had spent his entire career with, would not be continuing with the franchise, according to ESPN’s Ohm Youngmisuk.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI knew a little bit before everybody,” Jokic said. “And he told me, â\\x80\\x98We made a decision.â\\x80\\x99 So it was not a discussion. It was a decision, and he told me why. So I listened and I accept it.â\\x80\\x9d\\nIn the wake of the move, the Nuggets picked up a win over the Kings, under interim coach David Adelman. According to The Denver Post’s Bennett Durando, the coaching staff tried to give players more flexibility to be communicative, including Jokic explaining plays and using the whiteboard during the team huddle.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cPeople say that we are vulnerable, but the beast is always the strongest or the most dangerous when theyâ\\x80\\x99re vulnerable,” Jokic said. “Maybe [team president and governor Josh Kroenke] woke up the beast.\\n“I mean, when someone wants to wake somebody up or change the energy, thatâ\\x80\\x99s probably what they do. In my country, if somebody gets fired â\\x80¦ probably youâ\\x80\\x99re the next [to go]. So I think it definitely changed something, and they got the reaction that they wanted, probably.”\\nJokic emphasized that the change simply emphasized the nature of the NBA, and that the Nuggets needed to process the move quickly with the playoffs looming. Still, Jokic developed a close relationship with Malone and made sure to reach out and check on him afterward.\\n“It was a 10-year relationship,” Jokic said. “So it was just, it was a heavy day for everybody. Especially for him and his family.“\\n8 thoughts on “Nikola Jokic Comments On Nuggets’ Coaching Change”\\nWould Kuminga and Post be enough to get Joker in San Francisco?\\nThe entire Warriors roster is not enough for Jokic.\\nLol what?\\nNo.\\nI guess you didn’t hear.

We strive to be the “go-to” resource for power professionals, offering a wealth of information on innovative business practices, sound safety measures, useful productivity enhancements, and much more.\\nPJM Taps Google and Tapestry to Use AI for Grid Interconnection Planning\\nPJM, the largest grid operator in North America, has launched a multiyear partnership with tech giant Google and its Alphabet X moonshot Tapestry to streamline PJM’s grid interconnection process using artificial intelligence (AI) tools. The companies said the effort could significantly improve planning and decision-making as grid pressures intensify.\\nUnder the initiative, announced on April 10, Tapestry, powered by Google Cloud and Google DeepMind, “will build on its core technology and develop a new set of AI tools and models” to “intelligently manage and optimize interconnecting power generation to the PJM electric grid,” said Ruth Porat, president and chief investment officer for Alphabet and Google.\\nThe technology will be designed to fast-track how PJM connects new energy sources to its grid by deploying Tapestry’s AI-powered tools, she said. The tools will help automate the application intake and data verification process, unify disparate grid modeling databases into a single, collaborative platform, and support the faster integration of variable energy resources—such as wind, solar, and storage—that now dominate PJM’s interconnection queue.\\nShe said the key aim is to ease the burden on planners and developers, speed up project approvals, and enhance affordability and reliability across the PJM region. However, the effort could also serve as a blueprint for grid operators facing similar concerns, offering a scalable model that could be adapted to accelerate clean energy integration across other U.S. regions and international systems.\\n“This is the first time artificial intelligence is being used to manage the entire energy interconnection queue and process, as opposed to point solutions,” said Page Crahan, general manager of Tapestry, during the April 9 press roundtable. “We are bringing more energy capacity on the grid faster. We’re driving efficiency and affordability by enabling more projects to send power to the grid and meet the region’s energy needs as efficiently as possible. And we are integrating more diverse energy resources—solar, wind and storage project capacity currently makes up over 90% of the PJM interconnection queue—and our Tapestry’s AI powered tools can support the rapid and reliable integration of these sources into the grid.” Ultimately, she said, “it’s worth reminding ourselves what’s at stake here, what the opportunity is. Investing in energy infrastructure unlocks significant growth in prosperity and economic activity.”\\nConsiderable Potential for PJM\\nThe partnership brings together PJM, the largest regional transmission organization (RTO) in North America, with Alphabet’s internal innovation lab and cloud computing division to address the growing backlog of power generation projects. By the end of 2023, more than 2,600 GW of capacity was waiting in interconnection queues nationwide, more than double the size of the current U.S. power fleet, according to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.\\nAs POWER reported earlier this month, grid operators have stepped up efforts to reform interconnection processes, but backlogs remain a critical concern. PJM in February told lawmakers that in 2023, only 4,800 MW were interconnected into the system with 180,000 MW of capacity. Of the approximately 50,000 MW that have completed PJM’s process, most are still not moving forward. That poses precarious implications for the grid operators supply picture, which, like other grid operators, is grappling with a confluence of system stresses that could threaten reliability.\\n“We project in the 2022 to 2030 timeframe that we could lose up to 40,000 MW—or 40 GW—of generation off the PJM system, and that’s due primarily to government and corporate policies that are putting pressure on our fossil fuel fleet,” said Aftab Khan, PJM’s executive vice president for Planning, Operations, and Security on Wednesday.“And there are economic factors, but you can see that that represents about 21% of our installed capacity.”\\nAt the same time, new capacity is not arriving fast enough to fill the gap. “The concern that we also have is the pace of new entry of generation resources is also not happening at an adequate enough pace, we believe, to replace the risk of retiring resources,” Khan said. “So taken together, our concerns around retiring generation, slow pace of entry and significant electric demand growth poses significant risk for PJM to maintain reliability going into the future.”\\nPJM’s 2025 forecast reflects a dramatic shift in load trends. “Starting in 2023 and accelerating in 2024, and most recently, earlier this year, with our 2025 forecast, we started to project very significant peak electric demand growth—and this is driven by data centers, but also electrification of transportation and heating, and a resurgence of manufacturing,” he said.\\n“Generators who want to connect to PJM need to go through an interconnection cycle process, and we’ve been taking several actions to improve that,” Khan said. “We used to do a serial, first-come, first-serve interconnection process that resulted in a very significant backlog of generation interconnection requests. So we worked with our stakeholders beginning in 2021, ultimately leading to a FERC filing to transform to more of a grouping or cluster-based approach, and putting in criteria that’s more of a first-ready, first-serve.”\\nBut even with those reforms,PJM sees room for improvement, Khan said. “Even though we’ve made significant progress with tools and automation to manage large numbers of projects in an interconnection cycle, it’s still end-to-end about a two-year cycle process,” Khan noted. “And we know that we need to continue to invest and look at all avenues to improve our interconnection process.”\\nKhan said the collaboration with Google and Tapestry is part of a broader strategy to accelerate project approvals and improve the interconnection cycle. “We see a huge potential to drive efficiency and quality improvements in the overall process,” he said. “It’s very difficult at this time to quantify and say, ‘Hey, this is what we’re going to achieve,’ but I can only say that I think there’s a huge potential for us.”\\nTapestry’s Vision: A Unified, Intelligent Grid Model\\nTapestry’s Crahan described the initiative as a “first-of-its-kind” strategy aimed at consolidating and contextualizing grid data. “We think about creating the world’s first knowledge graph for the electric grid,” she said. The idea draws directly from Google’s success organizing the internet: “We set out to do the same thing for the electric grid,” she explained, “and the information required that brings together all sorts of disparate data into a single place.”\\nShe added: “You can think about something like the impact of Google’s knowledge graph on the way we search for the Internet—making it easy to ask a question and have somebody, a source, bring the information together to inform your trusted decisions and follow up.”\\nWhile the power sector already generates large volumes of data, she stressed that it’s often disjointed and unusable for decision-makers. “Sometimes it may even be too much data, so much that it’s not helpful for the decision makers to make sense of it all, to bring it all together in a single view,” she said. “The folks who are making decisions about our network are using multiple screens, spreadsheets, different software, and technical diagrams—not to mention the actual cacophony of alerts that go off in a control room in a challenging moment.”\\nTapestry’s solution is a cloud-based, version-controlled, and collaborative model of the PJM grid—what Crahan called “Google Maps for electrons.” The goal, she said, is to replace the current patchwork of tools—each modeling different aspects of the grid—with a shared, unified environment that can “track changes so that developers, planners, and operators can access everything they need to make really critical decisions in one place.”\\nThe project will roll out in phases over several years. “We’re developing a new set of tools expanding on that work, helping PJM to connect energy sources to the grid much, much faster,” Crahan said. First, the platform will introduce tools to streamline the interconnection application process, using natural language processing to, for example, “drag and drop a PDF and have it intelligently assess what is in that application.” These tools will automate and improve the data verification process for key factors such as land rights, equipment specs, and grid impacts.\\nThe second major feature targets the lack of a unified model. “Grid planners assess whether they can connect new projects to the grid [by consulting] dozens of tools. They’re looking at different maps, databases, models and evaluation tools, and it is a lengthy process which can create some of the bottlenecks that we’d like to address,” she said. These tools don’t talk to each other, she noted. “Every time a change is made to that one model, it needs to be applied to all of the other models in consideration,” she explained. “Since these models are siloed, it is extremely difficult to manage all of this data and keep a consistent and updated set of information.”\\nCrahan described two core systems already deployed internationally: a grid planning tool that enables long-term simulations “at hourly resolutions up to 20 years in the future,” and GridAware, a suite of tools that uses computer vision and vehicle-mounted cameras (like Google Street View) to rapidly inspect physical infrastructure. “That dramatically accelerates grid inspection and repair processes,” she said, and “allows grid operators [and] field service technicians to proactively maintain the network for a more resilient grid.”\\nUltimately, Crahan said, “we want to really bring the data that is engaged and available in the network and turn it into knowledge, so that the experts have what they need to make decisions about our grid of the future.”\\nThe Planned Rollout\\nThe companies said the tools will be rolled out in phases, beginning with development and limited testing in 2025. While PJM has not yet committed to formally adopting the AI tools as part of its standard interconnection process, the collaboration marks the start of an intensive co-development effort aimed at eventual integration.\\n“This is the kickoff of the collaboration. I would just emphasize this is really innovation, first-of-its-kind work,” said Crahan. “So nothing will be integrated into PJM process tomorrow, but we are beginning the work of developing these tools together,” she said. “Our plan is to be delivering solutions that PJM can start using this year—in 2025—but again, the most important thing above all is ensuring that whatever we deliver and build with that Tapestry meets the reliability and the sort of interoperability and operational needs of the PJM working team. So we will be working very closely on developing the tools, starting now imminently, and we will be working with PJM on how they integrate into their process over the next several quarters and throughout, hopefully, as we build upon this great work, perhaps even the next several years.”\\nCrahan also said that PJM will make decisions on what the best tools are that can conduct their responsibilities. “Tapestry is responsible for building something that is really incredibly helpful, and delivering that in a reliable, meaningful, deployable, secure way,” she said.\\nHow the Initiative Compares to Industry-Wide Applications\\nTapestry’s AI-powered grid planning tools have already demonstrated measurable success in international applications. “Because Tapestry doesn’t have our own electric grid to experiment with, we have been working closely with partners around the world for the last seven years, working in New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, the UK, working in Chile, and, of course, working in the U.S.,” said Crahan\\nA collaboration with Chile’s national grid operator, Coordinador Eléctrico Nacional (CEN), helped planners dramatically accelerate long-term simulations, she noted.\\xa0 “What we’ve seen is the planners that are using our grid planning tool are able to simulate their grid 86% faster,” she said. “They’re running 30 times the number of scenarios that they used to run a single scenario in.” She added that Tapestry has also layered in advanced weather forecasting capabilities from Google DeepMind to improve wind predictions, enhancing confidence in grid planning decisions.\\nTapestry’s initiative echoes broader efforts to modernize the grid with AI, but it appears to stand apart—for now—for its focus on integrating siloed models and offering real-time, version-controlled collaboration. By contrast, the Open Power AI Consortium—launched just weeks ago in March 2025 by EPRI, NVIDIA, and startup Articul8—is developing domain-specific large language models trained on curated energy-sector datasets. The goal is to help utilities streamline operations, accelerate interconnection studies, and prepare critical filings such as licenses, permits, and rate cases. EPRI says the consortium’s first open AI model, trained on hundreds of NVIDIA H100 GPUs, could cut interconnection study timelines by up to 5x. The consortium also includes power providers like Duke Energy, PPL, PG&E, Exelon, and Portland General Electric, alongside tech partners like AWS, Oracle, and Microsoft.\\nOther efforts are emerging in parallel. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) is developing eGridGPT, a research initiative to apply generative AI in the control room. Developed using open-source models and validated against digital twin simulations, the system supports real-time decision-making by grid operators through scenario analysis, action simulation, and equipment model mapping. Its multimodal capabilities include natural language interpretation of operator prompts coupled with explainable AI outputs grounded in physics-informed modeling.\\nFederal engagement in AI for grid planning is also ramping up. In November 2024, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) launched its Artificial Intelligence for Interconnection (AI4IX) initiative, offering up to $30 million to fund AI applications that streamline the nation’s generation interconnection process. The program, managed by ConnectWerx under a Partnership Intermediary Agreement with DOE’s Grid Deployment Office, targets a key chokepoint: reducing deficiencies in interconnection applications that delay analysis. Among its goals are accelerating application intake automation, improving site control verification, and enhancing data transparency—in line with the DOE’s broader i2X roadmap to modernize interconnection nationwide. DOE says more than 90% of interconnection applications submitted to some RTOs are currently deemed deficient, prolonging project timelines by years.\\nNumerous commercial platforms also use AI to improve grid operations, but few address interconnection queue management. IBM’s ELVIS, Siemens Energy’s Omnivise, and GE Vernova’s ThinkLabs and GridOS DERMS focus on reliability, forecasting, and DER coordination. GridUnity is a notable exception, offering automated workflows for interconnection.\\n“I see workflow automation happening for addressing the interconnection queue and transmission planning, and certainly applying AI in that domain is great,” said Crahan. “In our observation, that really doesn’t get necessarily to the heart of the challenge of unifying all these disparate models.” She emphasized that Tapestry’s work is complementary to existing efforts focused on point solutions or simulation tools. “What Tapestry views as a missing piece—and a real unlock for speed and data validation—is synthesizing those things, unifying them so planners and decision-makers can see them all together in one place.”\\nThe scale of the PJM initiative is also unprecedented, she said. PJM’s footprint covers spans the District of Columbia and 13 states across much of the industrial Mid-Atlantic and Midwest. The technology could ultimately deliver power that is more reliable and affordable for the 67 million people PJM serves, noted Amanda Corio, head of Data Center Energy at Google.\\nGoogle’s incentive to participate in the solution is to bolster its broader initiatives to add firm, clean capacity to the grid. “We remain committed to our goals to decarbonize our electricity footprint, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and matched on an hourly basis by 2030,” Corio said. Google is also backing advanced nuclear and enhanced geothermal, and has co-located data centers with new generation to ease grid burdens, she noted.\\n—Sonal Patel is a POWER senior editor (@sonalcpatel,\\xa0@POWERmagazine).\\nSHARE this article\\nRecommended\\nNation’s Power Operators Warn Congress of a Coming Reliability Shortfall\\nPower and Data Center Sectors Join Forces to Resolve Mounting Electricity Demand Uncertainties\\nFERC Blocks PJM Proposal to Expand Amazon Data Center Load at Susquehanna Nuclear Plant\\nPJM Capacity Auction Prices Surge Over Nine-Fold, Signal Urgent Need for New Power Generation\\nMore Trends News\\nSeven major U.S. grid operators have raised a unified alarm about an impending capacity crunch, warning that the pace and…\\nIn January, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said U.S. wholesale electricity prices were less volatile in 2024 than they…\\nGas power is experiencing a stunning resurgence, driven by soaring electricity demand.

Their skill, speed and ruthless edge drew comparisons to some of the very best trios that have graced European football in the modern era.\\nAdvertisement\\nWe asked eight of our writers to take a trip down memory lane and reflect on the greatest attacking trios they can remember in the competition’s storied history.\\nThis list isn’t exhaustive, but the talent included is enough to get you whistling the Champions League theme tune.\\nLionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar at Barcelona\\nWe could just play the numbers game. In the three years they played together, Messi, Suarez and Neymar scored a combined total of 363 goals in all competitions. In the 2015-16 season alone, they scored 131 between them: 59 for Suarez, 41 for Messi and 31 for Neymar.\\nBut even those astonishing numbers don’t do justice to the brilliance of this trio. It wasn’t just three top-class players carrying an attacking threat, it was three of the most talented forwards in the history of the game combining — again and again and again — in such a mesmerising, instinctive manner that it took the sport to another level.\\nBarcelona have had a few forward lines like that over the years, going back to Johan Cruyff’s “dream team” of the early 1990s, then the Rivaldo-Kluivert-Saviola triumvirate of the mid-2000s and the various sides Pep Guardiola built, with first Thierry Henry and Samuel Eto’o, and later David Villa and Pedro offering the perfect accompaniments to Messi’s genius.\\nBut the so-called ‘MSN’ partnership that followed in the mid-2010s was something else entirely: three extraordinarily gifted forwards selfless enough to bring out the best in each other.\\n⭐️ #UCLclassics ⭐️\\n🔙 in #UCLfinal 2015: @neymarjr 🆚 Juventus ⚽️💪🏆#UCL | @FCBarcelona | @fcbarcelona_br https://t.co/f1v6UsC0hA pic.twitter.com/Fr9RMikmIx\\n— UEFA.com DE (@UEFAcom_de) April 22, 2020\\nOliver Kay\\nMohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino at Liverpool\\nIn their first of five Champions League seasons as a front three, Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Roberto Firmino did not mess about. They each scored 10 times as Liverpool made it to the 2017-18 final in Kyiv.\\nTheir sweeping counter-attacks will live long in the memory. There was nothing quite like the giddy and exhilarating feeling of watching those three red arrows darting towards goal and into the record books. They restored the meaning of European nights at Anfield and redefined them for an entire generation of fans.\\nIn total, Salah, Mane and Firmino scored a combined 338 goals and assisted 139 times in their five campaigns together. Naturally, they saved some of their best work for Champions League nights by scoring 77 goals and 26 assists combined, and they made up for their final defeat to Real Madrid in 2018 by winning the competition in 2019.\\nAdvertisement\\nAnd in their last season of Champions League football, just like in their first, they reached a third final, and while they lost to Real Madrid again, they helped rewrite the narrative. Liverpool came back to Europe’s prestige competition in 2017 as underdogs, but going into the 2022 final in Paris, many had them down as favourites.\\nThat stellar front three who never gave up were a big reason why.\\nCaoimhe O’Neill\\nGareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo at Real Madrid\\nLet’s get this out of the way early doors — no, Real Madrid’s ‘BBC’ attacking trio of Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo probably did not possess the creative spark of Barcelona’s rival ‘MSN’, but they were devastatingly effective when in full flow.\\nTake the 2013-14 season, when Madrid ended their long wait for a 10th European Cup/Champions League title — known as ‘La Decima’ in Spanish — and the three players contributed 97 goals across all competitions. A staggering 51 of those efforts were scored by a certain Portuguese star, but Benzema knitted it all together. Bale, meanwhile, recovered from no pre-season following his record move from Tottenham Hotspur to score 22 times and provide 19 assists.\\nOpposition defences could not cope en route to that title. Benzema, Bale and Ronaldo each scored twice in a 6-1 humiliation of Schalke in a round of 16 first leg.\\nBale and Ronaldo helped down Borussia Dortmund in the quarter-final; two goals from Ronaldo in the semi-final second leg against Bayern Munich guided Madrid to a crushing 4-0 win at the Allianz.\\nSergio Ramos’ 93rd-minute header took the final against Atletico Madrid to extra time, but Bale’s header after Angel Di Maria’s run finally broke Atletico’s spirit — before Ronaldo predictably removed his shirt following his 120th-minute penalty to make it 4-1.\\nThere were reports of friction between Ronaldo and Bale — later denied by Bale — and the Welshman’s injuries meant he was not always a mainstay, particularly after falling out of favour under Zinedine Zidane. But the trio still helped Madrid win three Champions League titles in a row from 2016 to 2018 before Ronaldo’s exit to Juventus broke up the band. In the five seasons they played together, they scored 442 goals between them.\\nAdvertisement\\nBenzema summed up their success best in an interview with RMC Sport in 2019: “You had a rocket, Bale, the scorer, Cristiano, and I was the piece between the two to make it all work.”\\nTomás Hill López-Menchero\\nArjen Robben, Franck Ribery and Robert Lewandowski at Bayern Munich\\nFirst, the obvious point: the potency and the danger they represented.\\nArjen Robben and Franck Ribery played with other Bayern forwards — Mario Gomez, Thomas Muller and Mario Mandzukic — but consider the span of attributes among those three when it included Robert Lewandowski. Two of the most dangerous out-to-in wingers in Champions League history coupled with — perhaps — the best one-touch, close-range finisher the competition has ever seen.\\nWhat else do you need? That trio, together, had a wonderful symmetry and balance to it, and the reliability of its output was really what gave Bayern that sense of inevitability during their imperial phase.\\nBut what often gets missed, particularly with Ribery and Robben, is the relentlessness. They were killers. Emotionally resilient. They may have been decadently gifted with the ball at their feet — Robben with those frantic touches, Ribery with his crab-like gait — but they also kept going at their opponents, again and again, and never lost faith in their ability to make a defence crack.\\nA nightmare to face, surely, and near impossible to subdue.\\nSeb Stafford-Bloor\\nLionel Messi, Pedro and David Villa at Barcelona\\nThis is Messi’s second entry onto the list and, in truth, it could be made up of every front line he ever played in. But my favourite is the team from Pep Guardiola’s third season at Barcelona, when they won La Liga and won back the Champions League.\\nThe previous season, Guardiola had brought in Zlatan Ibrahimovic but lost his team’s dynamism in doing so. So in summer 2010, he rebuilt around speed and around Messi. Ibrahimovic was gone, David Villa came in, and the system clicked perfectly into place: Messi in a deep central role, Villa and Pedro high and wide, attacking the space behind the defence, creating the space for Messi to shine in.\\nAdvertisement\\nIts genius was in its simplicity. But even if you grasped the theory, it was impossible to stop. The 2011 Champions League final was its climax and the ultimate proof of its strength. Manchester United were scared of the speed of Villa and Pedro, who scored the first. They sat back and Messi scored the second. Villa added the third in the second half.\\nIt was the culmination of a season of the best football you will ever see.\\nThe nail in the coffin. @Guaje7Villa @ChampionsLeague 2011 #OnThisDay pic.twitter.com/gc136bf52f\\n— FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona) May 29, 2020\\nJack Pitt-Brooke\\nCristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney and Carlos Tevez at Manchester United\\nStrictly speaking, they weren’t a front three, but if anything, that only made Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tevez even harder to defend against.\\nLook at a team sheet from Manchester United’s 2007-08 campaign, and Rooney and Tevez are typically listed as a front two, with Ronaldo nominally playing wide right. But then how many archetypal chalk-on-your-boots wingers score 42 goals in 49 games, as the Portuguese did that year?\\nThat tells you everything about how this other United trinity actually played on the pitch as opposed to on paper — as a fluid, interchangeable blend of power, technique, and aggression, granted the freedom to come at opponents from all angles.\\nTogether, they hit a combined 79 goals during the 2007-08 campaign — including 16 in the Champions League, and all but one of United’s knockout stage goals on the way to beating Chelsea in the Moscow final.\\nAnother 61 followed the season after, including Ronaldo’s Puskas-winning piledriver away at Porto in the last eight. So did a second consecutive Champions League final, this time ending in defeat to Barcelona in Rome.\\nRonaldo against Porto = 🚀🤯#UCLdraw | @juventusfcen pic.twitter.com/HJ4PysyDuK\\n— UEFA Champions League (@ChampionsLeague) December 14, 2020\\nBy then, the band was breaking up. Ronaldo’s head had been inexorably turned towards Real Madrid. Tevez, already sidelined by Dimitar Berbatov’s signing, did not start the 2009 final and went on to damage his standing among United’s supporters by joining Manchester City.\\nA little over a year after Moscow, Rooney was the only one left. Speaking to the Stick to Football podcast last year, he agreed that his days alongside Ronaldo and Tevez was the peak of his playing career.\\nAdvertisement\\n“Unfortunately, we were in the era of that Barcelona team, which were incredible,” he said. “But for those few years, you felt unstoppable.”\\nMark Critchley\\nSamuel Eto’o, Lionel Messi and Ronaldinho at Barcelona\\nRanking Barcelona’s greatest attacking units is a task both as absurdly difficult as it is rewarding. You have to pore over so many combinations — but you also get to remember them all along the way.\\nAnd this mid-Noughties trio was everything: laden with creativity, generational talent and goals.\\nYou’ve got Samuel Eto’o scoring for fun, winning the La Liga golden boot in 2005-06. You’ve got Ronaldinho as the showboating Obi-Wan Kenobi, teaching a teenage Lionel Messi how to handle the force.\\nJust to witness either one of those mercurial players dovetailing with a goal machine like Eto’o would be special — but both? A Ronaldinho in the prime of his years, having helped Barca win back-to-back Spanish league titles (2004-05, 2005-06) and the Champions League in 2006, even if his star had begun to wane near the end of their triumvirate (he would join Milan in 2008).\\nMeanwhile, Messi was watching and learning. The staggering flow of goals had not fully arrived for the Argentinian at that point, although he became the first Barca player to win the Golden Boy award, aged 18, in 2005.\\nPerhaps the Bernabeu Clasico in that 2005-06 season showcased the trio’s brilliance best. Considering they were up against a not-too-shabby Real Madrid side itself, featuring David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane and Ronaldo, among others, Barca dominated, with Eto’o and Ronaldinho scoring wonderful goals, and Messi a constant threat in a manner which suggested what was to come.\\nGreg O’Keeffe\\nAlessandro Del Piero, Fabrizio Ravanelli and Gianluca Vialli at Juventus\\nYou won’t find any numbers here. This trio are from a time before football was gripped by statistics, before anyone discussed revenue, and before players could be ‘pure profit’.\\nThey represent an era when football was all heart, and that rich, beating heart was in Italy; Serie A undoubtedly the best league in Europe, this trio as that league’s apotheosis.\\nThe way they could move the ball, control the ball, control the game; and they looked so perfect doing it: the shining Gianluca Vialli, Fabrizio Ravanelli with his distinctive white hair, and Alessandro Del Piero, who, at this point, had his pirate-esque sideburns that just kept going and going…\\nIn the summer of 1996, the three of them took Juventus to the Champions League final in Rome. Ravanelli scored their only goal, Ajax equalised, and the Italians won on penalties.\\nAdvertisement\\nAfter the final, Vialli left for Chelsea, Ravanelli left for Middlesbrough and Del Pierro stuck around at Juventus until 2012, but for that season, they caused beautiful panic in back lines across Europe, and they did it with an air of superiority that was merited.\\nAndrew Hankinson\\n(Top photo: Matthias Hangst/Getty Images)'}, {'title': \"IPL 2025: 5 milestones that can be achieved in today's CSK vs KKR match - Sportskeeda\", 'image_url': 'https://cdn.sports.hankooki.com/news/photo/201409/img_5323703_0.jpg', 'raw_content': 'Published Time: 2025-04-11T09:37:15+05:30\\nIPL 2025: 5 milestones that can be achieved in today\\'s CSK vs KKR match\\nYour login session has expired.

(Image Credits: iplt20.com)\\nChennai Super Kings (CSK) will meet Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in match number 25 of IPL 2025 at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on Friday, April 11. CSK will be led by MS Dhoni as regular skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad has been ruled out of the tournament due to a fractured elbow.\\nAd\\nChennai are on a four-match losing streak and would be desperate to turn things around. Their batting department is a major cause of concern as they are failing to chase down totals game after game. In their previous match, though, their bowling also let them down as they conceded 219 runs. Chasing 220, CSK came up with a reasonable effort, but they still need to show massive improvement.\\nAs for KKR, they have won two and lost three of their five matches. In their last match, they went down to Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) by four runs in a high-scoring contest at Eden Gardens. Bowling first, Kolkata conceded 238-3. They fought valiantly in the chase, but were held to 234-7.\\nAd\\nTrending\\nIn the head-to-head numbers, CSK have a 19-10 lead over KKR. Meanwhile, several milestones could be achieved in the Chennai vs Kolkata clash at Chepauk on Friday. Here\\'s a lowdown.\\n1 MS Dhoni needs 5 sixes for 350 T20 sixes\\nDhoni\\'s batting position has been a debatable matter in IPL 2025. Fans and critics have questioned why he has been walking in when the game has been all but decided. Looking at his batting performance this season, he has scored 103 runs in 67 balls, striking at 153.73.\\nAd\\nExpand Tweet\\nAd\\nDhoni has struck six fours and seven sixes so far in IPL 2025. He needs five sixes to complete 350 sixes in his T20 career. In 396 matches (347 innings), the 43-year-old has smashed 345 sixes and 523 fours. The keeper-batter also needs five dismissals to complete 200 dismissals. He has 195 in 262 innings. Of his dismissals, 150 have been catches and 45 stumpings.\\n2 Sunil Narine needs 2 wickets to surpass Dwayne Bravo on list of IPL\\'s leading wicket-takers\\nKKR off-spinner Sunil Narine has picked up only two wickets in four innings so far in IPL 2025. He will be keen to come up with a much-improved effort against CSK. The West Indies cricketer needs two scalps to surpass Dwayne Bravo (183) and move to fifth on the list of IPL\\'s leading wicket-takers. In 181 matches, Narine has claimed 182 wickets at an average of 25.81 and an economy rate of 6.77.\\nAd\\n3 Rinku Singh needs 8 runs to complete 1,000 IPL runs\\nKKR finisher Rinku Singh has played a couple of impressive cameos in his last two visits to the crease. He smashed 32* off 17 against Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and 38* off 15 against LSG.\\nExpand Tweet\\nAd\\nThe southpaw is now eight runs away from 1,000 runs in the IPL. In 51 matches (44 innings), he has 992 runs to his name at an average of 32 and a strike rate of 146.09.\\n4 CSK batter Vijay Shankar 84 runs away from 2,500 T20 runs\\nCSK batter Vijay Shankar scored an unbeaten 69 off 54 balls in the match against Delhi Capitals (DC) at Chepauk. The 34-year-old is now 84 runs away from completing 2,500 runs in his T20 career. In 149 matches (119 innings), he has scored 2,416 runs at an average of 26.84 and a strike rate of 129.75. Of his 2,416 T20 runs, 1,195 have come in the IPL from 63 innings at a strike rate of 129.75.\\nAd\\n5 Venkatesh Iyer needs 60 runs to complete 1,500 IPL runs\\nKKR vice-captain Venkatesh Iyer found some form with a blazing 60 off 29 balls against SRH. In Kolkata\\'s previous match against LSG, he contributed 45 off 29. The left-hander is now 60 runs away from 1,500 IPL runs. In 56 matches (53 innings), he has scored 1,440 runs at an average of 31.30 and a strike rate of 138.32, with the aid of one hundred and 12 half-centuries.\\nAd\\nOther milestones that could be achieved in today\\'s CSK vs KKR match\\nRachin Ravindra needs 1 four to complete 100 T20 fours.\\nDevon Conway needs 1 six to complete 150 T20 sixes.\\nAjinkya Rahane needs 5 fours to complete 500 IPL fours.\\nVarun Chakaravarthy needs 6 wickets to complete 150 T20 wickets.\\nShivam Dube needs seven fours to complete 100 IPL fours.\\n×\\nFeedback\\nWhy did you not like this content?\\n[ ]\\nClickbait / Misleading\\n[ ]\\nFactually Incorrect\\n[ ]\\nHateful or Abusive\\n[ ]\\nBaseless Opinion\\n[ ]\\nToo Many Ads\\n[ ]\\nOther\\nCancel Submit\\nWas this article helpful?\\nThank You for feedback\\nAbout the author\\nRenin Wilben Albert\\nRenin Wilben Albert is a journalist who covers cricket at Sportskeeda.

(Image Credits: iplt20.com)\\nChennai Super Kings (CSK) will take on Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in match number 25 of IPL 2025 at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on Friday, April 11. CSK have suffered a big blow with skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad being ruled out of the remainder of the tournament due to a fractured elbow. MS Dhoni will thus lead the team for the rest of IPL 2025.\\nAd\\nGetting CSK\\'s campaign back on track will be a tough task for Dhoni as well. The team is languishing in ninth position in the points table, with four defeats in five matches. Chennai have just not looked in any sync at all in IPL 2025 so far. In their previous match, they went down to Punjab Kings (PBKS) by 18 runs in Mullanpur. Bowling first, CSK conceded 219 and were then held to 201-5.\\nAd\\nTrending\\nDefending champions KKR have only performed slightly better than Chennai.

Devon Conway looked in a decent touch in the previous game and could be one of the most important picks for the fantasy contests of the game.\\nNoor Ahmad\\nIPL 2025 Form: 11 Wickets in 5 Matches\\nThe Afghan spinner has so far been the greatest asset for the Chennai Super Kings in IPL 2025.

Shivam Dube played a decent knock in the last game and will be a key for the fantasy contests of this game.\\nKolkata Knight Riders\\nAjinkya Rahane\\nIPL 2025 Form: 184 Runs in 5 Matches\\nThe KKR skipper has so far been the best batter for the team in the tournament. Ajinkya Rahane has looked in a good touch in all the games and will be one of the top picks for the match.\\nVenkatesh Iyer\\nIPL 2025 Form: 114 Runs in 5 Matches\\nThe most costliest player in the KKR squad had a very average start to the tournament.

Jean Smart’s performance is a masterclass in how to break an audience’s heart\\nHacks should, by rights, be one of the biggest and best-loved shows on TV. It beat The Bear for outstanding comedy series at last year’s Emmys, and is a triumph of dazzling wit and some of the most lethal backstabbing ever committed to the small screen. In the UK, at least, it hasn’t made the largest impact: probably because, until recently, new seasons hadn’t streamed here since 2022. It recently found a home on Sky (thank goodness), just in time for this fourth outing, which comes complete with a load of starry cameos that HBO have demanded that journalists keep stumm about. If you thought that the toxic frenemy vibe between The White Lotus’s blond BFFs was lacking, say, 500% more shrieking; multiple HR complaints; comedy-flavoured barbs; and a drug-fuelled night out in Vegas, this is the show for you.\\nOnce again, we find ourselves in the company of veteran, vinegar-tongued comic Deborah Vance (Jean Smart) and Ava Daniels (Hannah Einbinder), the erstwhile protege she loves to hate. At the end of season three, their rollercoaster relationship made another hellish loop, with Ava blackmailing Deborah into appointing her as the head writer on her new late-night chatshow. As this season begins, the animosity between the pair is clear to anyone within a mile. “She just called you the C-word,” permanently exasperated manager Jimmy (Paul W Downs) tells Ava. “And not in a cool, RuPaul way – in an angry boomer way!” Deborah plays dirty, even sending an anonymous tip to the network that Ava is using drugs at work. But Ava knows that the best way to square-up to her boss is by putting that writerly brain to work and – at least in the first part of the series – Einbinder gets all the cattiest lines (among them: “Aren’t you and Mary Magdalene neck and neck for the title of world’s oldest whore?!”) Unfortunately for the pair, their unlikely collaboration is exactly the angle that the show’s PRs are trying to push, with the New York Times on board to publish a major feature on Ava’s crucial role in Deborah’s renaissance.\\nAva tries to commit to the bit as Deborah’s equal but, well, it doesn’t suit her, with Deborah’s psychic Diana (Polly Draper) informing her that she has a “rancid” energy radiating off her these days. Plumbing new depths of instability and misery, Einbinder continues to make Ava more than the sum of her socially anxious, millennial parts, fusing almost every line with a mixture of self-doubt and rage. Meanwhile, Smart offers another masterclass in how to break an audience’s heart – not least when her character has a health emergency – while making you wish that Ava had never unleashed Deborah 2.0 on the world.\\nMuch of the series is concerned with making the new late-night show a hit, with Deborah and Ava committing various microaggressions towards a terrified group of writers. It could come off as a little “inside baseball”, but – being Hacks – we eschew the knottier details of how network television works. The main thing is that their new venture needs to be a success. Or, as Helen Hunt’s straight-shooting exec Winnie tells them, “if you thought that getting this job was hard, that was easy compared to what you’re up against”. Thank God they have Shaboozey and Nancy Pelosi guesting on the show – although in a tragedy of Easter egg-sprinkling, we don’t actually see the country rapper and the former US Housespeaker get the Deborah treatment. As for Deb, she seems to have a wobble before her first appearance, something she vehemently denies (“I’ve never had stage fright – even when I performed in front of Saddam Hussein!”).\\nIt’s a pleasure to see the return of series stalwarts such as Downs (who is also a co-showrunner with Lucia Aniello and Jen Statsky), Mark Indelicato (Damien), Carl Clemons-Hopkins (Marcus) and my personal favourite, Megan Stalter as the idiotic but increasingly influential Kayla. There are a surfeit of excellent new additions this time around, too. It’s tough to pick out names in a cast this talented, but special praise must go to Julianne Nicholson as “Dance Mom”, a troubled viral star who feels like the kind of person Ellen DeGeneres would have made famous for 15 seconds in the 2010s. She has a lot of followers but – as Ava points out – so did Charles Manson. There should always be more screen time for Kaitlin Olson as DJ, but we’ll take what we’re given.\\nIn case I haven’t mentioned it enough already, season four of Hacks is very funny. But what makes it really special is just how raw it is, too, ready to hit you in the feels when you least expect it (there’s one hug, in particular, that left me questioning everything). Even when these two hate each other’s guts – which is most of the time – this truly is one of TV’s best love stories.\\nHacks season four is on Sky Max and is available on NOW.\\nMost viewed\\nMost viewed'}, {'title': 'The Top 5 Takeaways from INTRConnect 2025 - Insurance Journal', 'image_url': 'https://www.pointn.net/data/photos/adexpo/202204/N16496694655562_7b8edd.jpg', 'raw_content': \"Featured Stories\\nCurrent Magazine\\nThe Top 5 Takeaways from INTRConnect 2025\\nThis post is part of a series sponsored by Cotality.\\nWhile the Los Angeles wildfires disrupted and devastated so many lives, they also highlighted the urgent need for property insurance stakeholders to come together and start addressing the insurance crisis. That’s why Cotality™ hosted INTRConnect®, its annual conference for the property insurance ecosystem, last month in Los Angeles.\\nWith speakers, experts, and academics from all areas of property insurance, we gathered under the theme “Beyond All Limits.” Through enlightening presentations, engaging fireside chats, and spirited panel discussions, we partnered with industry experts to explore how to challenge existing norms and make strides toward building new, sustainable insurance frameworks.\\nHere are some key takeaways that can be used as a springboard as we all come together to create a more resilient insurance ecosystem:\\n1. The need for collaboration is even deeper than we thought.\\nSecuring affordable and adequate property insurance has become increasingly difficult nationwide. The crisis has reached a breaking point in states like California and Florida, which are prone to wildfires and hurricanes, respectively, every year. To reverse this trend and to prevent it from happening in other states, the entire property insurance ecosystem must embrace more strategic collaboration — beyond working seamlessly within organizations and with their restoration partners.\\nCarriers must first look at fellow insurers not as competitors, but instead as colleagues. Providers can determine strategies for distributing risk more effectively. This collaboration, especially within high-risk states, will help insurers ensure solvency, which in turn fosters long-term, widespread coverage.\\nDeeper collaboration also translates to insurers and restorers working closely with lawmakers and regulatory bodies. Risk is changing, and policy determines how people can bear it. Together, legislators, regulators, insurers and their partners can develop sustainable solutions that protect consumers while supporting insurer stability, ultimately creating a more resilient insurance landscape.\\nIn the collaborative ecosystem we need, there is no room for the blame game. The breakdown of the insurance system is not on the shoulders of regulators, insurers, or any other individual stakeholder. A confluence of factors caused the existential insurance crisis, and it will take the coordination of all players to rework the system into something sustainable.\\n2. Fixing the system goes beyond just insurance.\\nProperty insurance is critical to a healthy society. Without third-party protection of properties, secure homeownership unravels.\\nIn a growing number of states, non-fixed monthly costs like property taxes and insurance premiums have skyrocketed since 2020. These increases are making it harder for people to build equity or afford homeownership. Owning property is a cornerstone of long-term financial stability. We must prioritize building an insurance system that can sustainably offer affordable coverage. Every state needs a resilient insurance infrastructure to support communities that can thrive for generations.\\nToday, siloed processes across the real estate, mortgage, and insurance industries are preventing the kind of coordinated action needed to protect the American Dream. Together, these industries can plan how to build cities and communities that “do not burn,” in the words of speaker Michael Wara, the Senior Director for Policy at the Sustainability Accelerator within the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability. Stakeholders across property industries can coordinate to develop places where people can live securely, with far less exposure to environmental and financial risk.\\nAs Cotality Chief Scientist Howard Botts says, “we must break down the silos that define the traditional ecosystem of property-related industries. Without a united effort to find solutions, some parts of the country could become uninhabitable.”\\n3. Mitigation matters.\\nNatural disasters are not going to stop, but we can reduce the severity of their impact when they do occur.\\nWhat happened in LA in January 2025, like what happened in Maui in 2023, was an example of when a wildfire evolves into a conflagration— a large, uncontrollable fires that rapidly spread from structure to structure in the built environment. These blazes may begin as wildfires, but they grow into something more destructive as they are often further fueled by the materials of the structures they consume.\\nThis is where mitigation becomes crucial. When we build new communities or rebuild those impacted by wildfires or other natural disasters, we must design properties to be more resilient. By creating more resilient communities, we also create more insurable ones.\\nImplementing and fostering mitigation strategies involves various entities. We learned during a mainstage panel at INTRConnect that there are two key strategies for reducing risk: strengthening building codes and providing credits to incentivize policyholders to enact mitigation efforts on their properties. These measures become even more effective when governing bodies and carriers work together to ensure they are aligned.\\n4. Consumers are an important stakeholder in the process.\\nEngaging with policyholders is key. They are an integral part of the insurance ecosystem, not just beneficiaries.\\nGiven the complexity of insurance, it’s crucial for brokers and insurance company representatives not to just sell policies, but to engage consumers in the process so they fully understand their risks and coverage. With greater risk literacy, policyholders become part of the solution, equipped to actively participate in reducing their own risk, and in turn the risk of their neighborhoods and communities.\\nAs public consciousness of natural disasters and their destructive aftermath increases, risk education is a key to helping people realize that their insurance is not necessarily overpriced. They realize the value through understanding their coverage versus alternatives.\\n5. Imagination and innovation are how we go beyond all limits.\\nKeynote speaker Mick Ebeling — founder and CEO of Not Impossible Labs — reminded us everything was once impossible until someone made it possible. It all starts with a bold idea, and at INTRConnect, we put one forward: it’s within our collective reach to build a nationwide, affordable insurance system — one that supports homeownership and delivers lasting financial security for all.\\nThe path forward hinges on two essential ingredients: collaboration and innovation.\\nBy harnessing sophisticated tools and the increasing amount of data available to us today, we can shift from a “repair and replace” mindset to preventing the kind of loss we see today. Innovation, from artificial intelligence to other systems that help us make sense of property intelligence, can help us get ahead of risk. Through this digitally-minded, forward-thinking approach, the entire ecosystem can transform what once seemed impossible into something entirely within our reach.\\nIt won’t happen overnight, but by evolving our processes with developing technologies, we will get there — and the improvements along the way will yield transformational results to everyone in this ecosystem.\\nCotality’s vision of intelligence beyond bounds\\nAt INTRConnect 2025, we introduced our new name and brand to the world: We are now Cotality™. This announcement is a culmination of company’s transformation journey and its strategic efforts to meet the growing demands of the property industry—including insurance. Our market is changing, and we recognize the need to change with it. As we continue building people-centric solutions, this is a reflection of our revitalized commitment to collaboration, connectivity, and a forward-thinking approach to the property ecosystem.\\nAll the takeaways from INTRConnect 2025 underscore the tenets of Cotality — collaboration and connectivity, an approach of totality with the property data and insights for the property ecosystem and beyond, and the spirit of vitality to help the lives beyond the buildings.\\nWe look forward to fulfilling our mission over the next year and beyond, to support this entire ecosystem with intelligence beyond bounds™.

CSO Online의 기사에 따르면, 모든 인터넷에 연결된 기업은 사이버 공격의 표적이 될 수 있으며, 이에 따라 사이버 보험 정책을 주기적으로 검토하는 것이 필수적입니다. 이는 단순히 보험의 요건을 충족하는 것을 넘어서, 사내에서의 보안 태세를 강화하는 중요한 기회가 됩니다. 예를 들어, 원격 접속에 대한 취약점이 발견되어 공격자들이 VPN 통로를 노리고 있다는 사실이 드러났습니다. 이는 적절한 보안 업데이트가 없는 경우, 개인 PC 또한 쉽게 공격받을 수 있음을 시사합니다.\\n\\n**다양한 공격 기법**도 증가하고 있습니다. 예를 들어, 모바일 운영 체제인 Android에서의 보안 취약점(CVE-2024-53150, CVE-2024-53197)이 발견되었으며, 이는 사용자의 데이터 탈취에 악용될 수 있습니다. 삼성과 같은 제조사들이 업데이트를 늦추면서, 사용자들이 이러한 취약점에 계속 노출되고 있습니다. 따라서, 사용자는 항상 최신 소프트웨어로 업데이트하는 것이 필수적입니다.\\n\\n**의료 분야의 이메일 보안 공격**도 주요 이슈 중 하나입니다. HIT Consultant는 2025년에 의료 기관들이 이메일을 통한 공격의 주요 표적이 되고 있다고 보도했습니다. 이는 주로 사기성 이메일과 고위직 임직원 스푸핑을 통해 이루어지며, 특히 환자 데이터와 재정 데이터의 안전성이 위협받고 있습니다. AI 기반의 피싱 공격의 증가도 보안 위협을 더욱 복잡하게 만들고 있습니다.\\n\\n이에 따라, 기업과 개인 모두는 **다층 보안 접근 방안**이 중요하다는 점을 인식해야 합니다. 보호 조치로는 MFA(다중 인증)와 EDR(엔드포인트 탐지 및 대응), 그리고 정기적인 보안 교육의 실시가 필요합니다. 이 외에도 비밀번호 관리자 프로그램을 도입하거나, 제로 트러스트 네트워크 접근을 적용함으로써 보안 태세를 강화할 수 있습니다.\\n\\n결론적으로, 앞으로도 지속적으로 evolve하는 보안 위협에 대한 대비가 필요하며, 이는 개인 PC와 기업 환경 모두에 적용됩니다. 정기적인 소프트웨어 업데이트와 개선된 보안 프로토콜을 적용하는 것이 보호의 첫걸음입니다. 최신 보안 트렌드와 사례를 항상 주의 깊게 살펴보는 것이 중요합니다. 독자 여러분도 이러한 정보를 통해 더욱 안전한 디지털 환경을 구축하시길 바랍니다.'}}\n",

OpenAI는 공식적으로 2024년 12월 출시 계획을 부인하며, 올해 ‘Orion’ 모델이 출시되지 않을 것이라고 밝혔습니다. 이에 대해 CEO 샘 알트만은 ‘가짜 뉴스’라고 반박하며, 모델 출시 일정의 불확실성을 강조했습니다.\\n\\n‘Orion’ 모델은 기존의 GPT-4보다 최대 100배 더 강력할 것으로 예상되었지만, 발표 지연으로 인한 기술적 경쟁에서의 기회 손실이 우려되고 있습니다. 특히 Microsoft와의 파트너십을 통해 Azure에서 조기 호스팅이 가능하다는 소식이 있었지만, 구체적인 계획은 아직 미비한 상태입니다.\\n\\n현재 OpenAI는 ‘Orion’ 외에도 ‘Strawberry’라는 다른 모델을 개발 중입니다. 이는 OpenAI가 단일 모델에 집중하기보다는 다양한 접근 방식을 통해 기술을 발전시키고 있음을 의미합니다. 또한 알트만 CEO는 최근 트위터에서 “밤하늘은 정말 아름답고, 겨울 별자리를 기대하고 있다”라는 메시지를 남기며, 향후 모델에 대한 기대감을 조절하는 발언을 했습니다.\\n\\n결론적으로, ‘Orion’ 모델의 발표 지연은 OpenAI의 기술 개발 로드맵에 중대한 영향을 미치고 있으며, 향후 모델 공개 일정은 여전히 미지수입니다. 이러한 변화는 AI 업계의 경쟁 구조와 기업 전략에 커다란 영향을 미칠 것으로 보입니다.\\n\\n## OpenAI와 Anthropic 간의 추론 모델 경쟁은 어떻게 진행되고 있을까?\\n\\nAI 분야의 경쟁이 심화되는 가운데 OpenAI와 Anthropic 간의 새로운 동향이 주목받고 있습니다. 두 기업 모두 사용자 컴퓨터에서 온라인 작업을 수행할 수 있는 AI 시스템, 즉 컴퓨터-사용 에이전트(CUA)를 개발하고 있습니다. 이러한 시스템은 사용자 요구에 맞춰 효율적으로 작업을 수행하는 데 중점을 두고 있으며, 현재 구글의 ‘프로젝트 자비스’와 OpenAI의 ‘스트로베리’ 프로젝트가 대표적입니다.\\n\\nOpenAI는 ‘스트로베리’ 프로젝트를 통해 인터넷에서 독립적으로 탐색하고 깊이 있는 연구를 수행할 수 있는 AI 모델을 개발 중입니다. 반면, Anthropic은 ‘클로드 3.5 소네트’ 모델을 통해 사용자에게 기존의 컴퓨터 작업을 처리할 수 있는 능력을 제공합니다. 이러한 흐름은 AI 시스템이 사용자의 요구에 맞춰 작업을 자동화하고, 사용자 경험을 향상시키기 위한 기업 간 경쟁을 불러일으키고 있습니다.\\n\\nOpenAI는 ‘Orion’ 모델이 2024년 12월 출시되지 않을 것이라고 공식 발표했지만, 여전히 업계에서는 ‘Orion’이 100배 이상 강력한 모델이 될 것이라는 기대가 존재합니다. 이는 OpenAI가 지속적으로 기술 혁신을 시도하고 있다는 신호로 해석됩니다.\\n\\n마지막으로, 네이처의 연구 결과에 따르면 인간과 AI의 조합이 항상 최적의 성과를 내지 않음을 명심해야 합니다. 연구는 인간과 AI의 결합이 특정 작업에서 훌륭한 성과를 낼 수 있지만, 다른 경우에는 오히려 저조할 수 있음을 시사합니다. 따라서 AI와 인간의 협력이 다양한 산업에서 어떻게 작용하는지를 검토할 필요성이 커지고 있습니다.\\n\\n## OpenAI의 리더십 변화가 기업 전략에 미치는 영향은 무엇인가?\\n\\nOpenAI 내부에서 발생한 리더십 변화는 기업 전략에 상당한 영향을 미칠 것으로 예상됩니다. 이러한 변화는 새로운 비즈니스 모델 개발, AI 기술의 배포에 대한 접근법, 그리고 조직문화의 변화를 반영하고 있습니다.\\n\\nWharton 대학교의 Ethan Mollick 교수는 기업이 AI의 혜택을 제대로 누리기 위해서는 조직 차원에서의 변화가 필수적이라고 강조합니다. AI 기술은 개인 단위에서 사용하는 것을 넘어 전략적으로 배치되어야 하며, 변화하지 않으면 큰 이익을 보지 못할 것이라는 경고도 덧붙였습니다.\\n\\nAI와 인간의 협력의 중요성도 간과할 수 없습니다. Averi AI와 같은 스타트업은 AI를 활용하여 마케팅 업무를 자동화하면서도 여전히 인간의 전문성이 필요하다는 점을 강조합니다. 이러한 접근은 기업이 AI 도구를 적절히 활용하고 신뢰를 구축하는 데 도움을 줄 것입니다.\\n\\nAI 기술의 부정적 인식에도 불구하고, Adobe의 고위 임원들은 아티스트들이 AI 기술을 수용하지 않으면 성공하기 어려울 것이라는 강력한 메시지를 전달했습니다. 이는 기업들이 AI 기술을 통한 생산성을 강조하고 있으며, AI 도구가 사용자의 성공에 기여할 것이라는 확신을 나타냅니다.\\n\\nForbes의 연구에 따르면, 기업의 80%는 직원들이 성장 마인드셋을 가져야 수익이 증가한다고 응답했습니다. 직원들이 지속적인 학습과 개발을 통해 개인의 능력을 극대화할 수 있는 환경을 조성하는 것이 앞으로의 기업 전략에서 매우 중요할 것입니다.\\n\\nOpenAI의 리더십 변화는 단순한 조직 내 변화가 아니라, 기업이 AI를 통해 혁신할 수 있는 기회로 작용할 것입니다. AI의 도입이 조직문화와 전략적 접근 방식을 변화시키고, 결국 기업 전반의 생산성 향상 및 성장으로 이어질 가능성이 높습니다. 그러므로 기업의 리더십 또한 유연하고 혁신적인 사고를 가져야 합니다.\\n\\n## AGI 준비를 위한 안전팀 해체와 최고 고문 사임, 그 배경은 무엇인가?\\n\\n최근 인공지능(AGI) 발전을 위한 준비가 중요시되는 가운데, OpenAI의 안전팀 해체와 최고 고문의 사임이라는 중대한 사건이 발생했습니다. 이 과정에서 드러나는 이유와 전략을 살펴보겠습니다.\\n\\n첫째, 안전성을 강화하려는 노력이 있습니다. 최근 호주의 사이버 보안 회사 OpSys Australia는 첫 번째 정보 보안 최고 책임자로 샤나 데일리를 임명했습니다. 그녀는 사이버 운영 팀을 이끌며, 고객과 시스템 전체에 대한 보안을 강화하는 역할을 맡고 있습니다. 이러한 변화는 AGI와 관련된 데이터 및 시스템의 안전성을 보장하기 위한 선도적인 조치로 해석됩니다.\\n\\n둘째, 비용 효율성을 추구하는 움직임이 있습니다. 인도 타타 재단은 최근 CFO 및 COO의 직무를 제거하고 외부 컨설턴트의 의존도를 줄이는 재구성을 단행했습니다. 이는 급증하는 인건비와 행정 비용을 절감하고 본래의 자선 사명에 자원을 집중하기 위한 전략적 판단으로 보입니다.\\n\\n셋째, 조직의 민첩성을 높이기 위한 노력으로 볼 수 있습니다. 태타 재단이 채택한 보다 날렵한 관리 구조는 공동 결정 방식을 통해 운영 효율성을 높이고 AGI의 맥락 변화에 적절히 대응할 수 있도록 설계되었습니다. 이는 과거의 비효율성을 극복하고, 더 나은 의사결정을 통해 AGI 발전의 기회를 최대화할 수 있는 환경을 조성합니다.\\n\\n이러한 변화들은 AGI와 사이버 보안의 미래를 대비하기 위한 명확한 전략으로 읽을 수 있습니다. 중요한 것은 이러한 조치들이 기존의 대응 방식을 개선하고, 기술적 진보와 관련된 리스크를 얼마나 효과적으로 관리할 수 있을 것인가입니다. 향후 AGI 분야에서의 안전성과 혁신 사이의 균형을 맞추는 것이 주목됩니다. \\n\\n여러분의 의견은 어떠신가요? AI의 발전에 대한 여러분의 경험과 생각을 공유해 주세요!'\"\"\")"
