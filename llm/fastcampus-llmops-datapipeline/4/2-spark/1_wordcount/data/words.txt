Today’s generative AI is a consumer AI solution, even if consumers use it for work tasks, like creating presentations or summarizing online meetings. Tomorrow’s generative AI is an enterprise generative AI, focused on creating value for organizations in very specific areas, like improving healthcare outcomes, optimizing vaccine delivery, or tracing possible contamination through food chains. This enterprise-class generative AI requires enterprise LLMs – and new, trusted enterprise datasets now being created through ambient IoT.
With enterprise generative AI, augmented by ambient IoT data, the same supply chain manager can ask how to optimize their supply chain, based on data about their suppliers and the real-time movement and handling of their products and materials through their distribution channels. In other words, the finite universe of existing information about supply chains is augmented with near-infinite ambient IoT data about the actual products and conditions in those supply chains. And the manager isn’t just asking the LLM for information, they’re asking products themselves questions like: “Where are you now? What’s your condition? How can I get you from A to B more efficiently, sustainably and cost-effectively?”
