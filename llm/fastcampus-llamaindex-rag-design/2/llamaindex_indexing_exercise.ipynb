In those cases, it is important for people to get tested.Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d</p>\\n                <p>ItÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s impossible to get Covid-19 from a vaccine because <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/03/health/how-covid-vaccines-work/index.html\">there is no coronavirus in any of the vaccines</a> used in the US. </p>\\n                <p>But <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html#vaccinated\">Covid-19 vaccines donÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99t take full effect until 2 weeks after your final dose</a> Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x94 Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cso a person could get sick if the vaccine has not had enough time to provide protection,Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d the CDC said.</p>\\n                <p>Those who are <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/07/health/us-coronavirus-monday/index.html\">fully vaccinated are much less likely to get infected</a> than unvaccinated people, the CDC said. In addition, Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cCOVID-19 vaccines <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html#vaccinated\">reduce the risk of people spreading COVID-19</a>.Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d</p>\\n                <p>But while Covid-19 vaccines <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/28/health/covid-vaccine-myths-debunked/index.html\">are highly effective</a>, theyÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99re not perfect. The vaccines require an immune system response to work, so millions of <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/04/health/covid-19-vaccine-immunosuppressants/index.html\">Americans who are immunocompromised or take drugs that suppress the immune system</a> might not get as much protection from a vaccine as others do.</p>\\n                <p>The good news: When rare breakthrough infections do happen in vaccinated people, theyÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99re usually less severe, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/p0607-mrna-reduce-risks.html\">CDC research shows</a>.</p>\\n                <p>But itÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s especially important for <em>un</em>vaccinated people who have Covid-19 symptoms to get tested. <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/effectiveness/why-measure-effectiveness/breakthrough-cases.html\">Unvaccinated people can spread coronavirus more easily than vaccinated people</a>, the CDC said.</p>\\n                </div>\\n                    <div class=\"question-t\"><span>Work/life</span> <span>vaccine</span> <span>family</span> <span>transmission</span> <span>treatment &amp; prevention</span> </div>\\n                \\n                </div>\\n                \\n                \\n                <div id=\"is-it-safe-to-go-on-vacation\" class=\"question travel family transmission treatment-prevention worklife\">\\n                \\n                    <div class=\"question-q\">Is it safe to go on vacation?</div>\\n                    <div class=\"question-a\"><p>Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cDelay travel until you are <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html\">fully vaccinated</a>,Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d the CDC says. </p>\\n                <p>For those traveling within the US, you Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cdo NOT need to get tested or self-quarantine if you are fully vaccinated or have recovered from COVID-19 in the past 3 months. You should still follow all other travel recommendations,Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html\">the CDC says</a>.</p>\\n                <p>Americans traveling internationally should learn about the Covid-19 restrictions in place at their destination. Those flying back home to the US must provide <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/testing-international-air-travelers.html\">proof that they have recently tested negative for coronavirus or recently recovered from Covid-19</a>. They should also <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html\">get a viral test 3 to 5 days after coming home</a>, the CDC says. </p>\\n                <p>For those who arenÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99t fully vaccinated but must travel, the guidelines are much tougher. The CDC says itÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s important to wear a mask; get tested within three days before traveling; maintain physical distance from anyone not traveling with you; and quarantine for 10 days after you return home. (That <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/travel-during-covid19.html\">quarantine period can be reduced to 7 days if you get tested 3 to 5 days</a> after coming home.)</p>\\n                </div>\\n                    <div class=\"question-t\"><span>Travel</span> <span>family</span> <span>transmission</span> <span>treatment &amp; prevention</span> <span>work/life</span> </div>\\n                \\n                </div>\\n                \\n                \\n                <div id=\"whats-the-difference-between-the-delta-and-delta-plus-variants\" class=\"question transmission worklife schoolseducation vaccine travel variants\">\\n                \\n                    <div class=\"question-q\">What&#x27;s the difference between the Delta and Delta Plus variants?</div>\\n                    <div class=\"question-a\"><p>The Delta Plus variant (B.1.617.2.1) is a newer and slightly changed offshoot of the highly contagious Delta variant (B.1.617.2). </p>\\n                <p>All variants carry clusters of mutations. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/25/health/delta-plus-variant-explainer-intl-hnk-scn/index.html\">Delta Plus is different from Delta because it has an extra mutation called K417N</a>. That mutation affects the spike protein Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x93 the part of the virus that attaches to human cells it infects.</p>\\n                <p>The Indian governmentÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s Covid-19 genome sequencing body said the Delta Plus variant exhibits several <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/25/health/delta-plus-variant-explainer-intl-hnk-scn/index.html\">worrying traits such as increased transmissibility, stronger binding to receptors of lung cells, and a potential reduction in antibody response</a>.</p>\\n                <p>ItÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s not yet clear what effect the mutation may have on vaccine efficacy.

HEPA filters are used by hospitals to create sterile rooms for surgeries and to control infectious diseases. TheyÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99re able to remove 99.97% of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria and other airborne particles as small as 0.3 microns. </p>\\n                <p>For context, this coronavirus is thought to be <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/07/health/covid-19-air-conditioning-ventilation-wellness-scn/index.html\">between 0.06 to 1.4 microns in size</a>. </p>\\n                <p>But Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cHEPA filtration is not always going to be feasible or practical,Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d Allen said.

Ventilation systems with highly effective filters are a key way to eliminate droplets from the air, said Harvard environmental health researcher Joseph Gardner Allen.</p>\\n                <p>Filters are rated by a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/07/health/covid-19-air-conditioning-ventilation-wellness-scn/index.html\">MERV system</a> Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x93  their Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cminimum efficiency reporting valueÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d that specifies their ability to trap tiny particles. The MERV ratings go from 1 to 20. The higher the number, the better the filtration. </p>\\n                <p>HEPA filters have the highest MERV ratings, between 17 and 20. HEPA filters are used by hospitals to create sterile rooms for surgeries and to control infectious diseases. TheyÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99re able to remove 99.97% of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria and other airborne particles as small as 0.3 microns. </p>\\n                <p>For context, this coronavirus is thought to be <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/07/07/health/covid-19-air-conditioning-ventilation-wellness-scn/index.html\">between 0.06 to 1.4 microns in size</a>. </p>\\n                <p>But Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cHEPA filtration is not always going to be feasible or practical,Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d Allen said. Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cBut there are other filters that can do the job. What is recommended now by the standard setting body for HVAC is a MERV 13 filter.Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d </p>\\n                <p>High-efficiency filters in the 13-to-16 MERV range are often used in hospitals, nursing homes, research labs and other places where filtration is important.</p>\\n                <p>Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cIf youÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99re an owner of a home, building or mall, you want to have someone to assess your system and install the largest MERV number filter the system can reliably handle without dropping the volume of air that runs through it,Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d advised Erin Bromage, an associate professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.</p>\\n                <p>Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cIn addition, virtually all modern air conditioning systems in commercial buildings have a process called makeup air where they bring in air from outside and condition it and bring it inside,Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d Bromage said. Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9cItÃ¢Â\\x80Â\\x99s worse in regards to energy, but the more outside air we bring in, the more dilution of the virus we have and then the safer you are.Ã¢Â\\x80Â\\x9d</p>\\n                </div>\\n                    <div class=\"question-t\"><span>Transmission</span> <span>family</span> <span>work/life</span> <span>schools/education</span> </div>\\n                \\n                </div>\\n                \\n                \\n                <div id=\"what-does-asymptomatic-mean\" class=\"question worklife transmission schoolseducation\">\\n                \\n                    <div class=\"question-q\">What does asymptomatic mean?</div>\\n                    <div class=\"question-a\"><p>Asymptomatic describes a person who is infected but does not have symptoms.
