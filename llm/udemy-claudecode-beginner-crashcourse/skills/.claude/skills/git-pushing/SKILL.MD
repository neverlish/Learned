# Git Push Workflow

Stage all changes, create a conventional commit, and push to the remote branch.

## When to Use

Automatically activate when the user:
- Explicitly asks to push changes ("push this", "commit and push", "push to remote")
- Mentions saving work to remote ("save to github", "push to remote")
- Completes a feature and wants to share it
- Says phrases like "let's push this up" or "commit these changes"

## Workflow

**ALWAYS use the script** - do NOT use manual git commands:

```bash
bash skills/git-pushing/scripts/smart_commit.sh
```

With custom message:
```bash
bash skills/git-pushing/scripts/smart_commit.sh "feat: add feature"
```

Script handles: staging, conventional commit message, Claude footer, push with -u flag.
