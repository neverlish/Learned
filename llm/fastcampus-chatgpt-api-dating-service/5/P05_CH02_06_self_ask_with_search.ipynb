Growing up in a working-class family, Campbell\\'s early life was marked by modest beginnings, yet it was clear from a young age that he had a passion for storytelling and the arts. His family\\'s support, though humble, played a pivotal role in encouraging his artistic ambitions. EXCLUSIVE: Former James Bond franchise director Martin Campbell speaks on whether any past candidate should be considered for the 007 role in Bond 26. The search for a new Bond continues. Screen Rant Daniel Craig and Martin Campbell during Daniel Craig Unveiled as the New James Bond in \"Casino Royale\" - Photocall at HMS President 72, St Katharine\\'s Way E1 in London, Great Britain. Martin Campbell became a sought-after action director thanks to his work on Goldeneye, the 1995 Pierce Brosnan Bond movie, which grossed $356 million worldwide. Campbell would later go on to direct a second Bond film in Casino Royale, which was an even bigger hit, grossing $616 million (and rumors have him also directing the upcoming Bond 26). Martin Campbell - For a training ground in England, it was terrific. I started off in the late \\'70s and early \\'80s doing all the one-hour British kind of Action shows and stuff.
