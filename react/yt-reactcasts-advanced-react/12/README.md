# Server Side Rendering

ReactCasts, episode 12.

Server Side rendering means rendering your React components on the Server, and sending HTML pages pre-populated - This can lead to a better user experience and Search Engine discoverability.

On the browser, when the javascript runs, react will realise that the component is already there and take over for front-end interactivity, skipping the initial render.
