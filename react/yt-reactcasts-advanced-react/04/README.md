# Contexts (Part 1)

ReactCasts, episode 4.

This is part one of a two-part screencast. Context makes it possible to pass data through the component hierarchy, without needing intermediate components to know about it. It can be useful for data that never (or rarely) change, such as theming and localization, and this screencast shows how to use Context using localization as example.
