# Immutability in JavaScript

ReactCasts, episode 9.

In this episode I'll talk about why immutability is important and how it can benefit you. I will draw some comparisons between JavaScript (which doesn't treat data as immutable by default) and programming languages that have immutability built in. Finally, I will show how to make immutable operations in plain Javascript.
